[<A HREF="#back">*</a>] BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE: The reprintings of this
book since Cole's
death in 1918 have involved very few changes, and in most cases it
has been bibliographically misleading to term them "editions".
Undoubtedly, somewhere in the past, the distinction between a
"printing" and an "edition" has not been understood. However, with
due cognisance of the irregularity, the practice of giving each
reprint a new edition number accompanied by a running sales total is
being maintained for statistical interest.</small>

<center><b>Australia Is The Best Country On Earth</b></center><br>
<p>
<center><b>Australia a Grand Country</b></center><br>
<p>
I think that Australia, for it's size, is, all-round, the best
country in the world. It's climate is pleasant and health-giving. It
has no desolating blizzards, no frost bites, and few sunstrokes. In
edible produce, for both size and quality, it stands very high, if
not the highest. I have been in many lands, but never saw a country
supply such a variety of products as Australia does&mdash;potatoes,
onions, cabbages, carrots, peas, beans and scores of other vegetables
in abundance. In fruits it produces apples, pears, plums, peaches,
oranges, grapes, and Northern Australia also produces all the
tropical fruits in abundance wherever cultivated. In corn Australia
produces superior wheat, oats, barley, maize and all other kinds in
abundance, especially when scientifically irrigated. As a milk,
butter and meat country, it is one of the best in the world. It is
the largest and best wool-producing country in the world. It contains
the largest area in the world especially suitable for growing cotton,
the most extensively-used clothing material. Flowers grow luxuriantly
and beautifully whenever cultivated and watered. A few years ago when
writing on the "White Australia" question, I stated that with high
culture, water irrigation, and scientific irrigation, Australia was
capable of supporting 400 millions of inhabitants. A high literary
authority, in reviewing the book, remarked that this seemed like a
"gross exaggeration"; but probably he had not thought so much on the
subject as I had.
<p>
I will here concisely state the principle reasons for my opinion. The
great want of Australia, to make it amazingly fruitful, is the
complete conservation of water and it's scientific application to the
soil. Water, warmth, and soil will grow anything in Australia, if
rationally managed. Australia has abundance of water now running to
waste. On thousands of house-roofs water enough is caught for the
domestic use of the respective families. Over large areas of the
country there are 30 inches of rainfall, and the average rainfall
over vast areas is 24 inches, and could be made much greater by
cultivation. Four-fifths of this water now runs to waste. Again
surface-parched Australia has vast areas of underground water which
only require to be tapped and brought to the surface, to irrigate and
fertilise the soil.
<p>
Australia is also a country where timber grows well and fast, if
planted in trenched ground and slightly irrigated. Hundreds of
straight trees can be grown upon an acre of land if they are first
planted thickly and some gradually thinned out. Many kinds of trees
will grow upon very poor soil if they are properly planted and
irrigated, as the bulk of their sustenance is derived from the air.
One more remark about trees and their possibilities as food
providers. Wherever any kind of tree will grow some kind of fruit
tree will grow. There are hundreds of millions of gum trees growing
in Australia. Where every one of these trees is, some kind of fruit
tree would grow if properly planted and looked after.
<p>
Again, to utilise Australia to it's full extent the whole world
should be sought through for the best plants and trees of every kind,
and only the very best grown, and those in situations and soil best
adapted for them.
<p>
One argument against Australia is that much of its surface is sandy,
but experiments and developments in various countries show that the
planting of marram grass, lupins, and other plants ties even the
drifting sand together and gradually, through their decay, turns the
sandy wastes into fertile soil. Besides, science can, in many other
ways, utilise the elements in the air to enrich the soil.

<center><b>Australia's Mineral Resources</b></center><br>
<p>
It has been objected that in the above epitome no mention is made of
the great mineral wealth of Australia. The reason is that minerals,
exceedingly useful as they are in the arts, are not absolutely
necessary (with the exception perhaps of iron) to the feeding,
clothing, and housing of mankind. Vast multitudes have lived without
them; but it may be remarked that Australia is a country very rich in
minerals; some hold it the richest in the world. It possesses immense
deposits of iron not yet utilised, and the most extensive gold-fields
yet discovered. Australia and Tasmania have, according to the latest
estimate of our Commonwealth Statistician, produced minerals to the
value of &pound;660,252,694&mdash;comprising in round numbers, Gold
&pound;474,000,000; Tin &pound;24,000,000; and other kinds
&pound;8,000,000. The bulk
of the above has been produced during the last 60 years, in a
population rising from about 300,000 to 4,000,000 and it forecasts
how vast the mineral-producing future of Australia is likely to be.
Altogether Australia is a country as highly favoured by nature as any
other of equal size upon earth, for the bountiful production of
useful animals, vegetables, minerals, and men.

<center><b>The Best Country On Earth&mdash;Unknown
Australia</b></center><br>
<p>
"'If we Australians took as much trouble to prepare for our summer
as the Canadians take to forestall their winter, Australia would be
THE MOST PROSPEROUS COUNTRY ON EARTH.'
<p>
The speaker was the Rev. A. R. Edgar, head of the Central Mission,
Melbourne.
<p>
"'After circling the globe, then, you are still satisfied that
Australia is not a bad country to live in?'
<p>
"'The best,' said Mr Edgar, emphatically. 'I have no hesitation in
saying that Canada and America are not to be compared with Australia.
Unfortunately, England doesn't know it. Australia herself doesn't
half realise it, and as for America and Canada, they haven't the
remotest ghost of a notion of it. In England they learn with
regrettable slowness, and their knowledge is scanty indeed; but
across the Atlantic the ignorance is deplorable. "Australia?" says
the Canadian. "Oh yes! Let's see, that's the place where it's always
droughty&mdash;yes, yes, to be sure, the place where y' can't get a
drink
of water." He laughs at the idea of Australia producing as much wool
and wheat as Canada, and bluntly tells you there's no country on the
face of the planet can grow wheat and wool like his. But the fact is,
there isn't a bit of territory fit to compare with the Western
District of Victoria, for example, and conditions are infinitely
harder for the agriculturist than in Australia. Canada's western
district is icebound in winter, and her eastern lands are strewn over
with great boulders, between which the plough works laboriously in
and out'."&mdash;From the "New Idea."
<p>
I often feel for the dweller in Canada; for notwithstanding his
beautiful spring and autumn he has six months of ice and snow and
freezing winds, and I feel selfishly grateful that my lot is cast in
more genial Australia.
<p>
Let us well ponder Mr. Edgar's concise and forcible statement: "If we
Australians took as much trouble to prepare for our summer as the
Canadians take to forestall their winter, Australia would be the most
prosperous country on earth."
<p>
This is quite true. The Canadian must thoughtfully and rationally
prepare for his winter, or he would freeze and starve. We have no
frigid climate to prepare against, but we have possible drought, and
our first and greatest consideration should be the conservation of
water for irrigation.
<p>
This water conservation is exceedingly important thing. Men do not
think, and the waste is enormous. When the rain falls it runs into
the gully, from the gully to the creek, from the creek to the river,
from the river into the sea; and then in the dry season water is
deplorably scarce.
<p>
I once asked a young squatter from the New South Wales side of the
Murray "Have you got a garden?" He answered: "No: it is too dry up
our way!" I said, "How do you get water for domestic purposes?" He
answered, "We catch it off the roof; we catch it in 11 tanks and are
never out of a supply." I asked, "How large an area have all your
roofs put together?" He answered, "I think about 20 feet by 100
feet." This would be about a twentieth of an acre. Now just reflect!
One acre of rainfall would supply, if caught, 20 establishments like
that squatter's home, for the rain would fall fairly alike over that
part of the country. A rainfall of 30 inches over an acre of ground
measures about 680,000 gallons and weighs about 3000 tons, the bulk
of which is allowed to run away every year!
<p>
A gentleman said to me the other day, "Since the water was brought to
Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie, under Sir John Forrest's great scheme, they
have very beautiful gardens right along the line of supply. Wherever
the water touches the land the vegetation is splendid, and, what is
more, the evaporation is bringing heavier rainfall." Of course,
wherever cultivation and irrigation are carried on, more evaporation
takes place, and, in most cases, causes additional rainfall.
<p>
When I affirmed that Australia was capable of supporting 400 millions
of people I did not mean Australia as we now have it, but as it might
be, and probably will be, when water is carefully conserved and its
soil scientifically irrigated and cultivated.

I suppose if all the children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who have lived through ages long,<br>
Were collected and inspected<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They would make a wondrous throng.<br>
<p>
Oh the babble of the Babel!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the flutter and the fuss;<br>
To begin with Cain and Abel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And to finish up with us!<br>
<p>
Some have never laughed nor spoken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never used their rosy feet;<br>
Some have even flown to heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere they knew that earth was sweet.<br>
<p>
And indeed, I wonder whether,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If we reckon every birth,<br>
And bring such a flock together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is room for them on earth.<br>
<p>
Think of all the men and women<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are now and who have been;<br>
Every nation since creation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That this world of ours has seen.<br>
<p>
And of all of them not any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But was once a baby small;<br>
While of children, oh, how many<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never have grown up at all.<br>

Our friend, the Quaker, holds that the last verse is the proper
one, as it is the truest; but the wonderful is taken out of it, and
children, accordingly, prefer the first. There is nothing wonderful
in the cow jumping "under" the moon, but there is in the cow jumping
"over" the moon, so with the black-birds baked in a pie. It is the
fact of their singing when the pie is opened that pleases the
children&mdash;'twas the wonder of the thing; so with the freaks of
Mother Hubbard's Dog, etc. In nearly all nursery rhymes it is the
ludicrous and wonderful that arrests the attention and pleases.<br>

<p>
Poor little Annie, you will find,<br>
Is very gentle, good, and kind,<br>
But soon a a fault appears.<br>
The slightest thing will give her pain,<br>
Her feelings she can ne'er restrain,<br>
But gives way to her tears.<br>
<p>
The other day when Ferdinand&mdash;<br>
And if you search throughout the land,<br>
No nicer boy you'll find&mdash;<br>
Said something which he never meant<br>
To cause the slightest discontent,<br>
For hours she sobbed and whined.<br>
<p>
Her father grieved, said: "This must cease<br>
We never have a moment's peace,<br>
She cries both day and night."<br>
A portrait painter then he paid,<br>
To paint his little tearful maid,<br>
Crying with all her might.<br>
<p>
He set to work that very day,<br>
Directly he received his pay;<br>
The picture soon was done.<br>
Yes, there she was, all sobs and sighs,<br>
Large tear-drops streaming from her eyes.<br>
"How like!" said every one.<br>
<p>
It was in truth a great success;<br>
Quite perfect, neither more nor less;<br>
Her father was so glad.<br>
He hung the portrait in her room;<br>
It filled her with the deepest gloom;<br>
She felt annoyed and sad.<br>
<p>
With every relative who came,<br>
And saw the picture, 'twas the same,<br>
All startled with affright.<br>
Uncles, and aunts, and cousins too,<br>
Found it so striking, life-like, true<br>
That soon they took to flight.<br>
<p>
Annie not long could this endure;<br>
It brought about a speedy cure,<br>
She ceased to cry and moan.<br>
Her father ceased to scold and frown,<br>
He had the picture taken down,<br>
And in the garret thrown.<br>

<center><b>Meddlesome Matty</b></center><br>
<p>
One ugly trick has often spoiled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweetest and the best;<br>
Matilda, though a pleasant child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One ugly trick possessed,<br>
Which, like a cloud before the skies,<br>
Hid all her better qualities.<br>
<p>
Sometimes she'd lift the teapot lid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To peep at what was in it;<br>
Or tilt the kettle, if you did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But turn your back a minute.<br>
In vain you told her not to touch&mdash;<br>
Her trick of meddling grew so much.<br>
<p>
Her grandma went out one day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And by mistake she laid<br>
Her spectacles and snuff-box gay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too near the little maid;<br>
"Ah! well," thought she, "I'll try them on,<br>
As soon as grandmamma is gone,"<br>
<p>
Forthwith she placed upon her nose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The glasses large and wide;<br>
And looking round, as I suppose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The snuff box she too spied:<br>
"Oh! what a pretty box is that;<br>
I'll open it." said little Matt.<br>
<p>
"I know grandmamma would say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Don't meddle with it, dear;'<br>
But then she's far enough away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And no one else is near;<br>
Besides, what can there be amiss<br>
In opening such a box as this?"<br>
<p>
So thumb and finger went to work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To move the stubborn lid;<br>
And presently a mighty jerk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The mighty mischief did;<br>
For all at once, ah! woeful case,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The snuff came puffing in her face.<br>
<p>
Poor eyes, and nose, and mouth beside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A dismal sight presented;<br>
In vain, as bitterly she cried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her folly she repented.<br>
In vain she ran about for ease;<br>
She could do nothing now but sneeze.<br>
<p>
She dashed the spectacles away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wipe her tingling eyes;<br>
And as in twenty bits they lay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her grandmamma she spies.<br>
"Heyday! and what's the matter now?"<br>
Says grandmamma, with lifted brow.<br>
<p>
Matilda, smarting with the pain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tingling still and sore,<br>
Made many a promise to refrain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From meddling evermore.<br>
And 'tis a fact, as I have heard,<br>
She ever since has kept her word.<br>

<center><b>Little Red Riding Hood</b></center><br>
<p>
Once upon a time there was a dear little girl whose mother made her a
scarlet cloak with a hood to tie over her pretty head; so people
called her (as a pet name) "Little Red Riding-Hood." One day her
mother tied on her cloak and hood and said,
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you to go to-day, my darling, to see your
grandmamma, and take her a present of some butter, fresh eggs, a pot of
honey, and a little cake with my love."
<p>
Little Red Riding-Hood loved her grandmother, and was very glad to
go. So she ran gaily through the wood, gathering wild flowers and
gambolling among the ferns as she went; and the birds all sang their
sweetest songs to her, and the bluebells nodded their pretty heads,
for everything loved the gentle child.
<p>
By and by a great hungry Wolf came up to her. He wished to eat her
up, but as he heard the woodman Hugh's axe at work close by, he was
afraid to touch her, for fear she should cry out and he should get
killed. So he only asked her where she was going. Little Red
Riding-Hood innocently told him (for she did not know he was a wicked
Wolf) that she was going to visit her grandmother, who lived in a
cottage on the other side of the wood. Then the Wolf made haste, and
ran through the wood, and came to the cottage of which the child had
told him. He tapped at the door.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who's there?" asked the old woman, who lay sick in bed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Little Red Riding-Hood, Grandmamma," answered the
Wolf in a squeaky tone, to imitate the voice of her grandchild.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pull the string, and the latch will come up," said the old
lady, "for I am ill and cannot open the door."
<p>
The cruel Wolf did so, and, jumping on the bed, ate the poor
grandmother up.
<p>
Then he put on her night-cap and got into bed. By and by Little Red
Riding-Hood, who had lingered gathering flowers as she came along,
and so was much later than the Wolf, knocked at the door.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who's there?" asked the Wolf, mimicking her grandmother's
voice.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"It is Little Red Riding-Hood, dear Grandmamma," said the
child.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Pull the string and the latch will come up," said the
Wolf.
<p>
So Red Riding-Hood came in, and the Wolf told her to put down her
basket, and come and sit on the bed. When Little Red Riding-Hood drew
back the curtain and saw the Wolf, she began to be rather frightened
and said,
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Grandmamma, what great eyes you have got!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the better to see you with, my dear," said the Wolf,
who liked a grim joke.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And what a large nose you have, Grandmamma!" cried the
child.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the better to smell you with, my dear."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And, oh! Grandmamma, what long white teeth you have!"
<br><p>
Alas! she reminded the greedy Wolf of eating.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"All the better to eat you with!" he growled; and, jumping
out of bed, sprang at Red Riding-Hood.<br>
<p>
But just at that moment Hugh the woodman, who had seen the sweet
child go by, and had followed her, because he knew there was a Wolf
prowling about the forest, burst the door open, and killed the wicked
animal with his good axe. Little Red Riding-Hood clung round his neck
and thanked him, and cried for joy; and Hugh took her home to her
mother; and after that she was never allowed to walk in the greenwood
by herself.
<p>
It was said at first that the Wolf had eaten the child, but that was
not the case; and everybody was glad to hear that the first report
was not correct, and that the Wolf had not really killed Little Red
Riding-Hood.

<center><b>The Babes In The Wood</b></center><br>
<p>
A long time ago there lived in an old mansion in the country a rich
gentleman and his wife, who had two dear little children, of whom
they were very fond. Sad to relate, the gentleman and lady were both
taken ill, and, feeling they were about to die, sent for the uncle of
the children, and begged him to take care of them till they were old
enough to inherit the estates.
<p>
Now this uncle was a bad and cruel man, who wanted to take the house,
the estates, and the money for himself,&mdash;so after the death of
the
parents he began to think how he could best get rid of the children.
For some time he kept them till he claimed for them all the goods
that should have been theirs. At last he sent for two robbers, who
had once been his companions, and showing them the boy and girl, who
were at play, offered them a large sum of money to carry them away
and never let him see them more.
<p>
One of the two robbers began coaxing the little boy and girl, and
asking them if they would not like to go out for a nice ride in the
woods, each of them on a big horse. The boy said he should if his
sister might go too, and the girl said she should not be afraid if
her brother went with her. So the two robbers enticed them away from
the house, and, mounting their horses, went off into the woods, much
to the delight of the children, who were pleased with the great
trees, the bright flowers, and the singing of the birds.
<p>
Now, one of these men was not so bad and cruel as the other, and he
would not consent to kill the poor little creatures, as the other had
threatened he would do. He said that they should be left in the woods
to stray about, and perhaps they might then escape. This led to a
great quarrel between the two, and at last the cruel one jumped off
his horse, saying he would kill them, let who would stand in the way.
Upon this the other drew his sword to protect the children, and after
a fierce fight succeeded in killing his companion.
<p>
But though he had saved them from being murdered, he was afraid to
take them back or convey them out of the wood, so he pointed out a
path, telling them to walk straight on and he would come back to them
when he had bought some bread for their supper; he rode away and left
them there all alone, with only the trees, and birds and flowers.
They loved each other so dearly, and were so bold and happy, that
they were not much afraid though they were both very hungry.
<p>
The two children soon got out of the path, which led into the
thickest part of the wood, and then they wandered farther and farther
into the thicket till they were both sadly tired, but they found some
wild berries, nuts and fruits, and began to eat them to satisfy their
hunger. The dark night came on and the robber did not return. They
were cold, and still very hungry, and the boy went about looking for
fresh fruit for his sister, and tried to comfort her as they lay down
to sleep on the soft moss under the trees.
<p>
The next day, and the next, they roamed about, but there was nothing
to eat but wild fruits; and they lived on them till they grew so weak
that they could not go far from the tree where they had made a little
bed of grass and weeds. There they laid down as the shades of night
fell upon them, and in the morning they were both in heaven, for they
died there in the forest, and as the sun shone upon their little pale
faces, the robins and other birds came and covered their bodies with
leaves, and so died and were buried the poor Babes in the Wood.

<center><b>Cinderella</b></center><br>
<p>
Cinderella's mother died while she was a very little child, leaving
her to the care of her father and her step-sisters, who were very
much older than herself; for Cinderella's father had been twice
married, and her mother was his second wife. Now, Cinderella's
sisters did not love her, and were very unkind to her. As she grew
older they made her work as a servant, and even sift the cinders: on
which account they used to call her in mockery "Cinderella." It was
not her real name, but she became afterwards so well known by it that
her proper one has been forgotten.
<p>
She was a sweet tempered, good girl, however, and everybody except
her cruel sisters loved her. It happened, when Cinderella was about
seventeen years old, that the King of that country gave a ball, to
which all the ladies of the land, and among the rest the young girl's
sisters were invited. So they made her dress them for this ball, but
never thought of allowing her to go.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish you would take me to the ball with you, sisters,"
said Cinderella, meekly.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Take you, indeed!" answered the elder sister with a sneer,
"it is no place for a cinder-sifter: stay at home and do your work."<br>
<p>
When they were gone, Cinderella, whose heart was sad, sat down and
cried; but as she sorrowful, thinking of the unkindness of her
sisters, a voice called to her from the garden, and she went to see
who was there. It was her godmother, a good old Fairy.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do not cry, Cinderella," she said; "you also shall go to
the ball, because you are a kind, good girl. Bring me a large pumpkin."
<p>
Cinderella obeyed, and the fairy touched it with her wand, turned it
into a grand coach. Then she turned a rat into a coach-man, and some
mice into footmen; and touching Cinderella with her wand, the poor
girl's rags became a rich dress trimmed with costly lace and jewels,
and her old shoes became a charming pair of glass slippers, which
looked like diamonds. The fairy told her to go to the ball and enjoy
herself, but to be sure and leave the ball-room before the clock
struck eleven. "If you do not," she said, "your fine clothes will all
turn to rags again.
<p>
So Cinderella got into the coach, and drove off with her six footmen
behind, very splendid to behold, and arrived at the King's Court,
where she was received with delight. She was the most beautiful young
lady at the ball, and the Prince would dance with no one else. But
she made haste to leave before the hour fixed and had time to undress
before her sisters came home. They told her a beautiful Princess had
been at the ball, with whom the Prince was delighted. They did not
know it was Cinderella herself.
<p>
Three times Cinderella went to royal balls in this manner, but the
third time she forgot the Fairy's command, and heard eleven o'clock
strike. She darted out of the ball-room and ran down stairs in a
great hurry. But her dress all turned to rags before she left the
palace and she lost one of her glass slippers. The Prince sought for
her everywhere, but the guard said no one had passed the gate but a
poor beggar girl. However, the prince found the slipper, and in order
to discover where Cinderella was gone, he had it proclaimed that he
would marry the lady who could put on the glass slipper. All the
ladies tried to wear the glass slipper in vain, Cinderella's sisters
also, but when their young sister begged to be allowed to try it
also, it was found to fit her exactly, and to the Prince's delight,
she drew the fellow slipper from her pocket, and he knew at once that
she was his beautiful partner at the ball. So she was married to the
Prince, and the children strewed roses in their path as they came out
of church.
<p>
Cinderella forgave her sisters, and was so kind to them that she made
them truly sorry for their past cruelty and injustice.

<center><b>The Three Bears</b></center><br>
<p>
Once upon a time three bears lived in a nice little house in a great
forest.
<p>
There was Father Bear, Mother Bear, and Baby Bear.
<p>
They had each a bed to sleep in, a chair to sit on, and a basin and a
spoon for eating porridge, which was their favourite food.
<p>
One morning the three bears went to take a walk before breakfast; but
before they went out they poured the hot porridge into their basins,
that it might get cool by the time they came back. Mr and Mrs Bear
walked arm-in-arm, and Baby Bear ran by their side. Now, there lived
in that same forest a sweet little girl who was called Golden Hair.
She, also, was walking that morning in the wood, and happening to
pass by the bear's house, and seeing the window open, she peeped in.
<p>

<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0 width="80%">
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD align="left">
There was no one to be seen, but three basins of steaming hot
porridge all ready to be eaten, seemed to say "Come in and have some
breakfast." So Golden Hair went in and tasted the porridge in all the
basins, then she sat down in Baby Bear's chair, and took up his
spoon, and ate up all his porridge. Now this was very wrong. A tiny
bear is only a tiny bear, still he has the right to keep his own
things. But Golden Hair didn't know any better.
<p>
Unluckily, Baby Bear's chair was too small for her, and she broke the
seat and fell through, basin and all.
<p>
Then Golden Hair went upstairs, and there she saw three beds all in a
row. Golden Hair lay down on Father Bear's bed first, but that was
too long for her, then she lay down on Mother Bear's bed, and that
was too wide for her, last of all she lay down on Baby Bear's bed,
and there she fell asleep, for she was tired.
<p>
By-and-by the bears came home, and Old Father Bear looked at his
chair, and growled:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somebody has been here!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother Bear growled more softly:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Somebody has been here!"<br>
<p>
Baby Bear, seeing his chair broken, squeeled out "Somebody has been
here, and broken my chair right through!"
<p>
Then they went to the table, and looked at their porridge, and Father
Bear Growled:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who has touched my basin?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mother Bear growled:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Who has touched my basin?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Baby Bear squeaked:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Somebody has broken mine and eaten up all my porridge!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They went upstairs and Father Bear
growled:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Who has been lying on my bed?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mother Bear growled:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Who has been lying on my bed?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Baby Bear squeaked out:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"O! here is a little girl in my bed; and it must be she who
has eaten my breakfast and broken my chair and basin!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Father Bear growled:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us eat her up!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Mother Bear growled:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us eat her up!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Tiny Bear squeaked:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Let us eat her up!"<br>
<p>
But the noise they made awoke Golden Hair; she startled out of bed
(on the opposite side) and jumped out of the window. The three bears
all jumped out after her, but they fell one on the top of the other,
and rolled over and over, and while they were picking themselves up,
little Golden Hair ran home, and they were not able to catch her.

<center><b>Bluebeard</b></center><br>
<p>
Once there lived in a lovely castle a very rich man called Bluebeard.
A short distance off lived an old gentleman with two lovely
daughters, named Fatima and Annie. Bluebeard visited their house, and
at length proposed to Fatima, was accepted by her, and they were
married with great splendour. He took her home with him to his
castle, and permitted her sister Annie to reside with her for company
for a time.
<p>
She lived very happily in her new home, her new husband was very kind
to her, and allowed her to have everything she wished for, but one
day he suddenly told her that business called him away from home,
that he should be away some days, and handed her the keys to his
wardrobe, treasures, and all parts of the castle, he also gave her
one key of a small closet, and told her that she might unlock every
door in the castle, but not the closet door, for if she did so, she
should not live an hour longer. He then left home fondly kissing her
at the door.
<p>
Her sister and herself returned into the castle, and enjoyed
themselves in unlocking room after room, looking over the
curiosities, treasures, &amp;c, until Annie became tired and lay down
to
rest on a rich sofa, and fell asleep. Fatima, as soon as she saw that
her sister was asleep, felt a womanly curiosity, an irresistible
temptation to unlock the forbidden closet, and take a peep.
<p>
She tripped lightly up to the door, turned the key in the lock,
pushed the door open, and, oh! horror! there were five or six dead
ladies lying in the closet, with their marriage rings on their
fingers. She at once concluded that they were Bluebeard's previous
wives, she let the key drop in her fright into the blood on the
floor, she picked it up and attempted to wipe it, but the blood would
not come off. She awoke her sister, and they both tried, but they
could not get it off, and gave it up in despair.
<p>
Just then Bluebeard suddenly returned, and asked his wife if she
could please to hand him the keys. She trembling did so. He said "How
came the blood on the closet key? You have disobeyed me, and shall
die at once."
<p>
She begged a few minutes to say her prayers and just as he was going
to chop her head off, her two brothers arrived at the castle, burst
open the door, killed the cruel wretch, and rescued their sisters.

The chill November day was done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The working world home a-faring,<br>
The wind came roaring through the streets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And set the gas lamps flaring.<br>
<p>
And hopelessly and aimlessly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The seared old leaves were flying,<br>
When, mingled with the sighing wind,<br>

<p>
And shivering on the corner stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A child of four or over;<br>
No hat nor cloak her small soft arms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wind-blown curls to cover.<br>
<p>
Her dimpled face was stained with tears;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her round blue eyes ran over;<br>
She crushed within her wee, cold hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A bunch of faded clover.<br>
<p>
And one hand round her treasures,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While she slipped in mine the other,<br>
Half-scared, half-confidential, said<br>

I've walked about a <i>hundred hours</i>,<br>

The monkey's gone; I've spoiled my flowers:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! please, I want my mother."<br>

"But what's your mother's name?<br>

"My mother's name is mamma dear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The street&mdash;I can't begin it."<br>
<p>
"But what is strange about the house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or new&mdash;not like the others?"<br>
I guess you mean my trundle bed&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine and my little brother's.<br>

Oh! dear, I ought to be at home,<br>

He's such a baby, he forgets,<br>

"And there's a bar between, to keep<br>

For Harry rolls when he's asleep&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! dear, I want my mother."<br>
<p>
The sky grew stormy, people passed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All muffled, homeward faring;<br>
"You'll have to spend the night with me,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I said at last, despairing.<br>
<p>
I spied a ribbon about her neck.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"What ribbon's this, my blossom?"<br>
"Why, don't you know?" she smiling asked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And drew it from her bosom.<br>

A card with number, street, and name!<br>

"For," said the little one, "you see<br>

Some names fit for every age,<br>

Some fit for dames of loftiest grades,<br>
Some only fit for scullery maids<br>
Ann is too plain and common,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Nancy sounds but ill;<br>
Yet Anna is endurable,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Annie better still,<br>

An elegance in Isabel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A haughtiness in Kate;<br>
And Sarah is sedate and neat,<br>

Matilda has a sickly sound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fit for a nurse's trade;<br>
Sophie is effeminate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Esther sage and staid;<br>
Elizabeth's a matchless name,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fit for a queen to wear<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;A name beyond compare;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Jane is too blunt and Bold,<br>
And Martha somewhat sorrowful,<br>

Amelia is too light and gay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fit for only a flirt;<br>
And Caroline is vain and shy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Flora smart and pert;<br>

But Alice&mdash;gentle, chaste and meek<br>
And Harriet is confiding,<br>

Matilda was a pretty girl,<br>

And yet she used those naughty words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sure I do not care."<br>
<p>
She once her lessons would not learn,<br>

And lost her tickets, but she said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sure I do not care."<br>
<p>
As she advanced to riper years,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry to declare,<br>
She still preserved those naughty words,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sure I do not care."<br>
<p>
She grew a woman, and for life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas time she should prepare,<br>
But still she said "there's time enough,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If not, I do not care."<br>
<p>
Duties neglected, warnings spurn'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her mother in despair;<br>
And though she saw the evil done,<br>

Still on she went from bad to worse,<br>

Afflictions came, and death in view,<br>

"Again, Matilda,<br>

Your needles, pins, your thread,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Your frock in tatters too;<br>
<p>
I'm now resolv'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No more delays to grant,<br>
This day I'll send you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To your stern old aunt."<br>
<p>
In vain Matilda wept,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Repented, pray'd,<br>
In vain a promise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of amendment made.<br>
<p>
Arriv'd at Austere Hall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Matilda sigh'd.<br>
By Lady Rigid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When severely eyed.<br>
<p>
"You read, and write,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And work well, as I'm told,<br>
Are gentle, kind, good-natur'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Far from bold.<br>
<p>
But very careless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Negligent, and wild&mdash;<br>
When you leave me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll be a different child."<br>
<p>
The little girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Next morn a favour asks:<br>
"I wish to take a walk,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Go learn your tasks,"<br>
<p>
The lady harsh replies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nor cry nor whine.<br>
Your room you leave not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till you're call'd to dine."<br>
<p>
As thus Matilda sat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erwhelm'd with shame,<br>
A dame appear'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Disorder was her name.<br>
<p>
Her hair and dress neglected,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Soil'd her face,<br>
She squinted leer'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hobbled in her pace.<br>
<p>
"Here, child," she said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"My mistress sends you this,<br>
A bag of silks&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A flow'r not work'd amiss&mdash;<br>
<p>
A polyanthus bright,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wondrous gay;<br>
You'll copy it by noon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She bade me say."<br>
Disorder grinn'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shuffling walk'd away.<br>
<p>
Entangled were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The silks of every hue,<br>
Confus'd and mix'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were shades of pink, green, blue;<br>
<p>
She took a thread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Compar'd it with the flow'r;<br>
"To finish this is<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not within my pow'r.<br>
<p>
Well-order'd silks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had Lady Rigid sent,<br>
I might have work'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If such was her intent."<br>
<p>
She sigh'd, and melted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into sobs and tears,<br>
She hears a noise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the door appears<br>
<p>
A pretty maiden, clean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well-dress'd, and neat<br>
Her voice was soft,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her looks sedate, yet sweet.<br>
<p>
"My name is Order,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not cry my love;<br>
Attend to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus you may improve."<br>
<p>
She took the silks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And drew out shade for shade,<br>
In sep'rate skeins,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each hue with care she laid;<br>
Then smiling kindly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Left the little maid.<br>
<p>
Matilda now resumed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sweet employ,<br>
And sees the flow'r complete&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How great her joy.<br>
<p>
She leaves the room,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I've done my task," she cries.<br>
But soon her harshness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady look'd<br>
With disbelieving eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chang'd to glad surprise.<br>
<p>
"Why this is well!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A very pretty flow'r,<br>
Work'd clean, exact,<br>
&nbsp;And done within the hour!<br>
<p>
And now amuse yourself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ride, walk or play."<br>
Thus passed Matilda<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This much-dreaded day.<br>
<p>
At all her tasks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Disorder would attend<br>
At all her tasks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still Order stood her friend.<br>
<p>
With tears and sighs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her studies oft began,<br>
These into smiles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were changed by Order's plan;<br>
<p>
No longer Lady Rigid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem'd severe,<br>
Her looks the negligent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone need fear.<br>
<p>
And when the day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wish'd-for day is come<br>
When young Matilda's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffer'd to go home:<br>
<p>
"You quit me, child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But oft to mind recall<br>
The time you spent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With me at Austere Hall.<br>
<p>
And now, my dear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll give you one of these,<br>
Your servant she will be;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take which you please."<br>
<p>
"From me," Disorder asked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Old friend, why start?"<br>
Matilda clasped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Order to her heart.<br>
"My dearest girl," she cried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"We'll never part."<br>

<p>
There was a girl, named tanglepate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She lived&mdash;I won't say where&mdash;<br>
Who was not willing any one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should comb or curl her hair.<br>
<p>
She cried and made a dreadful fuss,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At morning, noon, or night,<br>
And did not seem at all ashamed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of looking like a fright.<br>
<p>
Her hair stood out around her head<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like a lion's mane,<br>
And she was scolded, coaxed, and teased<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About it&mdash;but in vain.<br>
<p>
It caught on buttons, hooks, and boughs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As here and there she rushed,<br>
And yet she would not consent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To have it combed or brushed.<br>
<p>
And so she fell asleep one day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the woods, and there<br>
Two birdies came and built a nest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid her tangled hair.<br>

I know a very careless girl,<br>
Her hair is always out of curl,<br>
In rags and tatters are her clothes,<br>
And she's a fright, you may suppose.<br>

Her skirts she catches on a nail,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With not a bee about,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Which many will condemn;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;The traits of some of them.<br>
<p>
There's deli-Kate, a modest dame,<br>

She's nice and beautiful a flame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gentle as a dove,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As we may well suppose;<br>
Her fruitful mind is ever bent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On telling all she knows.<br>
<p>
There's intri-Kate, she's so obscure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis hard to find her out;<br>
For she is often very sure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To put your wits to rout.<br>
<p>
Prevari-Kate's a surly maid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She's sure to have her way;<br>
The cavilling, contrary jade,<br>

She is so faithless and untrue,<br>

<center><b>Coles Electro-micro Scolding Machine For Scolding Naughty
Girls</b></center><br>
<p>
Cole's Electro-micro Scolding Machine is a combination of three
instruments, the Phonograph, the Microphone, and the Wonderphone.
<p>
The Phonograph is an instrument that will preserve words for any
length of time. Any person can speak, sing, whistle, or scold into a
Phonograph, and months or years afterwards by simply turning a handle
the same sounds can be reproduced a dozen, a hundred, or a thousand
times in the exact voice of the person who spoke them in; so that if
a man or a woman, who is a great scold, speak some good, loud, severe
scolding into a Phonograph, the mildest teacher can then scold her
pupils, or the kindest mother her children, just by turning the
handle.
<p>
The Microphone is an instrument that magnifies sound in the same way
as a microscope magnifies objects; a very powerful microphone
magnifies the sound of a fly walking into a loud tramping footstep,
the tick of a watch into a deafening clatter, and a whisper into a
loud shout. Take a Microphone, then properly affix it to the
Phonograph described above, and you have a good Scolding Machine;
turn the handle, and as the Phonograph gives out the scoldings, the
microphone part magnifies them so loudly that they are heard for a
considerable distance.
<p>
The Wonderphone (Cole's own secret) is another remarkable instrument;
it will cause sound to travel very distinctly, but frightfully and
equally loud, for forty miles in all directions; by attaching this
powerful instrument to the combination of the other two, Cole's
Electro-micro Scolding Machine is formed&mdash;and which is the first
Scolding Machine ever invented. If the machine is already
<i>charged</i>
by having had some scolding spoken, or even whispered into it, give
the handle a turn, and forty miles to the east, forty miles to the
west, forty to the north, forty to the south, forty up in the sky,
and down in the mines forty miles deep, in fact forty miles in every
direction, everybody can clearly hear every word being said to the
girl being scolded. Suppose for instance, Hannah Maria Smith had done
something wrong in school, the schoolmistress could give the handle
of the machine a turn, and it would scold her so loudly that her
mother, and father, and brothers, and sisters, and uncles, and aunts,
and friends, and those she didn't like would all hear her scolded.
The machine can be charged on the instant by anyone scolding into it.
In fact the whole value of Cole's Scolding Machine lies in its power
to repeat out exceedingly loud whatever is spoken into it.
<p>
If the schoolmistress chooses she can put the scolding into verse, so
that all who hear it in the forty miles around, can more easily
remember it. The machine that I have before me now, was charged this
morning for an aristocratic school and speaks as
follows:&mdash;Silence!!
Attention!!!

<center><b>Notice To The Public</b></center><br>
<p>
If a schoolmistress chooses to live a hundred or a thousand miles
away from her school, she can use the Scolding Machine by means of a
<i>Telephone</i> attached thereto.
<p>
One great advantage of the Electro-micro Scolding Machine is, that
after it has been in use a short time the girls will all have been
shamed into good behaviour; but the Machine will not become useless,
as it can, without a farthing outlay, be turned into a Praising
Machine, for it can be made to praise in a gentle voice as well as
scold in a harsh one. In fact, as said above it will repeat in exact
tones, anything that is recited, preached, sung, whistled, whispered,
shouted, scolded or praised into it&mdash;and any of which will be
heard
for forty miles around.
<p>
Cole can supply Scolding Machines from &pound;5 to &pound;50. A very
good one
(The Excelsior), price &pound;10, can be charged in one minute, and
set
going like a musical box, and will sing, whistle, recite, preach, or
scold away for a full hour without stopping. Cole would particularly
recommend this one to the ladies, it would make a fine ornament for
their own table.
<p>
Final Notice Extraordinary&mdash;If the champion male scold of the
world,
and the champion female scold of the world, will call on Professor
Cole, at the Book Arcade, Melbourne, he will give them both good
wages, and find them constant employment at charging Scolding
Machines. If any wife has got the champion male scold for a husband,
she will please to let me know. If any husband has got the champion
female scold for a wife, he will please to let me
know&mdash;&pound;10 bonus
for information in each case.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<center><b>Jenny Lee</b></center><br>
<p>
An orphan child was Jenny Lee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her father, he was dead.<br>
And very hard her mother worked;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To get the children bread.<br>
<p>
In winter time, she often rose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long ere the day was light,<br>
And left her orphan family,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till dark again at night.<br>
<p>
And she would always say to Jane,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before she went away;<br>
"Be sure you mind the little ones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And don't go out to play.<br>
<p>
"Keep baby quiet in his bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as he will lie;<br>
Then take him up, and dance him well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't leave him there to cry.<br>
<p>
"And don't let little Christopher,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Get down into the street,<br>
For fear he meets an accident<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the horse's feet.<br>
<p>
"And mind about the fire, child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep a tidy floor;<br>
We never need be dirty, Jane,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we may be poor.<br>
<p>
"Good-by my precious comforter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all the neighbours say,<br>
That I can trust my little maid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever I'm away."<br>
<p>
Then Jenny she was quite as proud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As England's noble Queen,<br>
And she resolved to do the work,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep the dwelling clean.<br>
<p>
She did not stop to waste her time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But very brisk was she,<br>
And worked as hard and cheerfully<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As any busy bee.<br>
<p>
If down upon the cottage floor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her little brother fell,<br>
She stroked the places tenderly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kissed and made them well.<br>
<p>
And when the little babe was cross,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As little babes will be,<br>
She nursed and danced it merrily,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fed it on her knee.<br>
<p>
But when they both were safe in bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She neatly swept the hearth,<br>
And waited until her mother's step<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Came sounding up the path.<br>
<p>
Then open flew the cottage door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The weary mother smiled.<br>
"Ah! Jenny dear, what should I do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without my precious child!"<br>

<p>
Oft I had heard of Lucy Gray;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, when I crossed the wild,<br>
I managed to see at break of day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The solitary child.<br>
<p>
No mate, no comrade Lucy knew;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She dwelt on a wide moor,&mdash;<br>
The sweetest thing that ever grew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides a human door!<br>
<p>
You yet may spy the fawn at play,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hare upon the green;<br>
But the sweet face of Lucy Gray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will never more be seen.<br>
<p>
"To-night will be a stormy night&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You to the town must go;<br>
And take a lantern, child, to light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mother through the snow."<br>
<p>
"That, father, will I gladly do!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis scarcely afternoon&mdash;<br>
The minster-clock has just struck two,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yonder is the moon."<br>
<p>
At this the father raised his book<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And snapped a faggot band;<br>
He piled his work,&mdash;and Lucy took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lantern in her hand.<br>
<p>
Not blither is the mountain roe;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a wanton stroke<br>
Her feet disperse the powdery snow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That rises up like smoke.<br>
<p>
The storm came on before it's time;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She wandered up and down;<br>
And many a hill did Lucy climb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But never reached the town.<br>
<p>
The wretched parents all that night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went shouting far and wide,<br>
But there was neither sound or sight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve them for a guide.<br>
<p>
At day-break on a hill they stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That overlooked the moor;<br>
And thence they saw the bridge of wood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A furlong from their door.<br>
<p>
And, turning homeward, now they cried<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"In heaven we shall meet!"<br>
When in the snow the mother spied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The print of Lucy's feet.<br>
<p>
Then downwards from the steep hill's edge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They tracked the footmarks small;<br>
And through the broken hawthorn edge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the long stone wall.<br>
<p>
And then an open field they crossed&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The marks were still the same;<br>
They tracked them on, nor ever lost;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the bridge they came.<br>
<p>
They followed from the snowy bank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The footmarks, one by one,<br>
Into the middle of the plank;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And further there were none!<br>
<p>
Yet some maintain that to this day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a living child;<br>
That you may see sweet Lucy Gray<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the lonesome wild.<br>
<p>
O'er rough and smooth she trips along,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never looks behind;<br>
And sings a solitary song<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That whistles in the wind.<br>

I met a little cottage girl;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She was eight years old, she said;<br>
Her head was thick with many a curl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That clustered round her head.<br>
<p>
She had a rustic, woodland air,<br>

Her eyes were fair, and very fair,<br>

"Sisters and brothers, little maid,<br>

And two of us at Conway dwell,<br>

<p>
"Two of us in the churchyard lie&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My sister and my brother;<br>
And in the churchyard cottage I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dwell near them with my mother."<br>

If two are in the churchyard laid,<br>

<p>
"Their graves are green, they may be seen,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The little maid replied;<br>
"Twelve steps or more, from my mother's door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they are side by side.<br>
<p>
"My stockings there I often knit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My kerchief there I hem;<br>
And there upon the ground I sit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I sit and sing to them.<br>
<p>
"And often after sunset, sir,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When it is light and fair,<br>
I take my little porringer,<br>

"The first that died was little Jane;<br>

<p>
Once upon a time there lived in Cornwall, England, a lad whose name
was Jack, and who was very brave and knowing. At the same time there
was a great Giant, twenty feet high and nine feet round, who lived in
a cave, on an island near Jack's house. The Giant used to wade to the
mainland and steal things to live upon, carrying five or six bullocks
at once, and stringing sheep, pigs, and geese around his waist-band;
and all the people ran away from him in fear, whenever they saw him
coming.
<p>
Jack determined to destroy this Giant; so he got a pickaxe and
shovel, and started in his boat on a dark evening; by the morning he
had dug a pit deep and broad, then covering it with sticks and
strewing a little mould over, to make it look like plain ground, he
blew his horn so loudly that the Giant awoke, and came roaring
towards Jack, calling him a villain for disturbing his rest, and
declaring he would eat him for breakfast. He had scarcely said this
when he fell into the pit. "Oh! Mr. Giant," says Jack, "where are you
now? You shall have this for your breakfast." So saying, he struck
him on the head so terrible blow with his pickaxe that the Giant fell
dead to the bottom.
<p>
Just at this moment, the Giant's brother ran out roaring vengeance
against Jack; but he jumped into his boat and pulled to the opposite
shore, with the Giant after him, who caught poor Jack, just as he was
landing, tied him down in his boat, and went in search of his
provisions. During his absence, Jack contrived to cut a large hole in
the bottom of the boat, and placed therein a piece of canvas. After
having stolen some oxen, the Giant returned and pushed off the boat,
when, having got fairly out to sea, Jack pulled the canvas from the
hole, which caused the boat to fill and quickly capsize. The Giant
roared and bellowed as he struggled in the water, but was very soon
exhausted and drowned, while Jack dexterously swam ashore.
<p>
One day after this, Jack was sitting by a well fast asleep. A Giant
named Blundebore, coming for water, at once saw and caught hold of
him, and carried him to his castle. Jack was much frightened at
seeing the heaps of bodies and bones strewed about. The Giant then
confined him in an upper room over the entrance, and went for another
Giant to breakfast off poor Jack. On viewing the room, he saw some
strong ropes, and making a noose at one end, he put the other through
a pulley which chanced to be over the window, and when the Giants
were unfastening the gate he threw the noose over both their heads,
and pulling it immediately, he contrived to choke them both. Then
releasing three ladies who were confined in the castle, he departed
well pleased.
<p>
About five or six months after, Jack was journeying through Wales,
when, losing his way, he could find no place of entertainment, and
was about giving up all hopes of obtaining shelter during the night
when he came to a gate, and, on knocking, to his utter astonishment
it was opened by a Giant, who did not seem so fierce as the others.
Jack told him his distress, when the Giant invited him in, and, after
giving him a hearty supper, showed him to bed. Jack had scarcely got
into bed when he heard the Giant muttering to himself:

<p>
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0 width="80%">
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD align="left">
"Oh, Mr. Giant, is that your game?" said Jack to himself; "then I
shall try and be even with you." So he jumped out of bed and put a
large lump of wood there instead. In the middle of the night the
Giant went into the room, and thinking it was Jack in the bed, he
belaboured the wood most unmercifully; he then left the room,
laughing to think how he had settled poor Jack. The following morning
Jack went boldly into the Giant's room to thank him for the night's
lodging. The Giant was startled at his appearance, and asked him how
he slept, or if anything had disturbed him in the night? "Oh, no,"
says Jack, "nothing worth speaking about: I believe that a rat gave
me a few slaps with his tail, but, being rather sleepy, I took no
notice of it." The Giant wondered how Jack survived the terrific
blows of his club, yet did not answer a word, but went and brought in
two monstrous bowls of hasty pudding, placed one before Jack, and
began eating the other himself. Determined to be revenged on the
Giant somehow, Jack unbuttoned his leather provision bag inside his
coat, and slyly filling it with hasty pudding, said, "I'll do what
you can't." So saying, he took up a large knife, and ripping up the
bag, let out the hasty pudding. The Giant, determined not to be
outdone, seized hold of the knife, and saying, "I can do that,"
instantly ripped up his belly, and fell down dead on the spot.
<p>
After this Jack fought and conquered many giants, married the king's
daughter and lived happily.

<center><b>Jack and the Beanstalk</b></center><br>
<p>
At some distance from London, in a small village, lived a widow and
her son, whose name was Jack. He was a bold, daring fellow, ready
for any adventure which promised fun or amusement. Jack's mother had
a cow, of which she was very fond, and which, up to this time, had
been their chief support. But as she had for some time past been
growing poorer every year, she felt that now she must part with the
cow. So she told Jack to take the cow to be sold, and he was to be
sure to get a good round sum for her. On the road to market Jack met
a butcher, who was carrying in his hat some things which Jack thought
to be very pretty. The butcher saw how eagerly Jack eyed his beans,
and said, "If you want to sell your cow, my fine fellow, I will give
you this whole hatful of beans in exchange for her."
<p>
Jack was delighted; he seized the hat, and ran back home. Jack's
mother was surprised to see him back so soon, and at once asked him
for the money. But when Jack said he had sold the cow for a hatful of
beans, she was so angry that she opened the window and threw them all
out into the garden. When Jack rose up next morning he found that one
of the beans had taken root, and had grown up, up, up, until its top
was quite lost in the clouds. Jack resolved instantly to mount the
Beanstalk. So up, up, up, he went till he had reached the very top.
Looking round he saw at a distance a large house. Tired and weary, he
crawled towards it and knocked on the door. The door was opened by a
timid looking woman who started when she saw him, and besought him to
run away as her husband was a cruel Giant who would eat him up if he
found him there. But Jack begged so earnestly to be admitted that the
woman, who was very kind-hearted, had pity on him, and so she brought
him into the kitchen, and set before him on a table some bread, meat,
and ale. Jack ate and drank, and soon felt quite refreshed. Presently
the woman started and said, "My husband! quick, quick! he
comes&mdash;he
comes!" and opened the door to the oven and bid Jack jump in. The
Giant was in a dreadful passion when he came in, and almost killed
his wife by a blow which he aimed at her. He then began to sniff and
smell&mdash;at last he roared out:
</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<p>
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0 >
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD align="left">
"Fee, fa, fi, fo, fum,<br>

</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<p>
<TABLE cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0 width="80%">
<TBODY>
<TR>
<TD align="left">
His wife gave him an evasive answer, and proceeded to lay before him
his supper. When the Giant could swallow no more, he called out to
his wife to bring him his hen, which, after being brought, whenever
the Giant said "Lay," the hen laid a golden egg. The Giant soon fell
asleep, and Jack crept out softly and seized the hen, and made off
without disturbing the Giant. Away ran Jack till he came to the
Beanstalk; he was much sooner at the bottom of it now than at the top
in the morning; and running to his mother he told all his adventure.
<p>
The hen laid as many golden eggs as Jack liked, and his mother before
long had another cow and everything which she desired. A second time
Jack climbed the Beanstalk, when he ran away with the Giant's bag of
money. A third time Jack climbed the Beanstalk, and again gained
admission to the Giant's house. He saw the Giant's wife, and asked
her for a night's lodging. She at first said she could not let him
into the house, but Jack begged so hard that at last she consented,
and gave him some supper and put him to sleep in the copper boiler
near the kitchen fireplace, where she thought the Giant would not
find him.
<p>
When the Giant came in, his good nose served him in a moment: for he
cried out "I smell fresh meat." Jack laughed at this, but it was no
laughing matter; for the Giant looked all around the room, and even
put his finger on the lid of the copper, till it seemed as if a stone
of a hundredweight had fallen upon the lid.  Just then his wife came
in with a whole roasted bullock smoking hot, which the Giant sat down
and ate for his supper, and then went down into the cellar, and drank
about six gallons of Jamaica rum. The Giant now sat down and went to
sleep, and Jack tried to run away with his golden harp, an instrument
which, when the Giant said "play," played the most beautiful tunes.
Now the harp was a fairy, and as soon as he touched it, it called out
"Master! Master!" so loud that the Giant awoke, but he was some time
before he could understand what was the matter. He tried to run after
Jack, but Jack got to the top of the beanstalk first. When he had
descended a little way he looked up, and how great was his horror to
see the huge hand of the Giant stretched down to seize him by the
hair of the head! He slid and scrambled down the Beanstalk, hardly
knowing how, and seeing the Giant just putting his feet over the top,
he called out, "Quick, mother! A hatchet, a hatchet!" Jack seized it
and chopped away at the beanstalk, when down it fell, bringing along
with it the Giant. Jack instantly cut off his head. After this Jack
and his mother lived very happily, and Jack was a great comfort to
her in her old age.

<center><b>Hop O' My Thumb</b></center><br>
<p>
Once upon a time there was a woodman and his wife who had so many
children that they did not know how to find food for them. So one
night, when they were all in bed, the father told his wife that he
thought they had better take them into the forest and lose them
there. The youngest child, who was so very small that he was called
Hop o' my Thumb, overheard his father, and as he was a very clever
boy he made up his mind to find his way home again. So he went down
to the brook very early the next morning, and filled his pocket with
large smooth pebbles as white as snow. Bye-and-bye the woodman and
his wife told the children that they might go with them into the wood
to have a good game of play. They were all glad except Hop o' my
Thumb who knew what his father intended. So they set out; the woodman
and his wife first, then the boys, and last Hop o' my Thumb, who
sprinkled pebbles all the way they went.
<p>
They spent a merry day; but bye-and-bye the parents stole away, and
left the children all by themselves. They were very much frightened
when they missed their father and mother, and called loudly for them;
but when Hop o' my Thumb told them what he had heard, and how they
could find their way home by following the track of the pebbles,
which marked the way they had come, they set out, and reached home
safely, and their father and mother pretended to be very glad to see
them back.
<p>
But soon after they again resolved to lose their children, if
possible, in the forest. This time all the boys feared that they
should be left behind, and the eldest brother said he would take some
peas to sprinkle, to mark the pathway that led home. By-and-bye the
cruel parents stole away, and left the little ones in the dark wood.
At first they did not care, for they thought that they could easily
find their way home; but, alas! when they looked for the line of peas
which they had sprinkled, they found they were all gone&mdash;the
wood-pigeons had eaten them up, and the children were lost in the
wood. Holding each-others' hands and crying sadly they walked on to
seek a place to sleep in. By-and-bye they came to a giant's castle,
where they were taken in, and told that they might sleep in the
nursery with the seven baby daughters of the giant, who were lying
all in a row in one bed, with gold crowns on their heads. Hop o' my
Thumb thought it was strange that the giant should be so kind, as he
had been told that the ogres eat children. So in the night he got up
softly and took off the little giantesses' crowns and put them on his
brothers' heads and his own, and lay down again. It was lucky for him
that he did so, for in the night the giant came up in the dark to
kill the boys, that they might be ready for the next day's breakfast.
He felt the beds, and finding the crowns on the boy's heads took them
for his own children, left them and went to the other bed and cut off
the heads of his daughters instead. Then he went back to bed.
Directly he was gone, Hop o' my Thumb and his brothers got up, stole
down stairs, opened the door and fled away from the castle. But they
did not go far. Hop o' my Thumb knew that the giant would come after
them in his seven-league boots. So they got into a hole in the side
of a hill and hid. Very soon after, they saw the giant coming at a
great pace in his wonderful boots; but he took such long steps that
he passed right over their heads. They were afraid to move out till
they had seen him go home again. So they remained quietly where they
were.
<p>
By-and-bye the giant, who had been many miles in an hour, came back
tired, and lay down on the hill-side and fell asleep. Then Hop o' my
Thumb got out of the hole, and pulled off the giant's seven-league
boots, and put them on his own feet. They fitted him exactly, for
being fairy boots they would grow large or small just as one liked.
He then got his brothers out of the hole, took them in his boots,
marched for home, and although it was a great distance, got there in
almost no time, but when he arrived at the house his father and
mother were not there. He then hastened to make inquiries for them,
and found they had been suspected of murdering their
children,&mdash;who
had all disappeared suddenly&mdash;that they had owned to leaving
them in
the wood, and that they were to be put to death for their crime. "We
must go and save them," he said. So he took his brothers into the
seven-league boots, and set out to the place where their parents were
in prison. They arrived only just in time, for the guards were
bringing out the woodsman and his wife to put them to death. Hop o'
my Thumb took off the boors, and all the children called out, "We are
alive! we are alive! Do not kill our mother and father."
<p>
Then there was great joy. The woodman and his wife were set free, and
embraced their children. They had repented their wickedness, and were
never unkind and cruel any more; and Hop o' my Thumb kept them all in
comfort by going on errands for the king in his seven-league boots.

<center><b>Tom Thumb</b></center><br>
<p>
In the days of good King Arthur there lived a ploughman and his wife
who wished very much to have a son; so the man went to Merlin, the
enchanter, and asked him to let him have a child, even, if it were
"<i>no bigger than his thumb.</i>" "Go home and you will find one,"
said
Merlin; and when the man came back to his house he found his wife
nursing a very, very, wee baby, who in four minutes grew to the size
of the ploughman's thumb, and never grew any more. The fairy queen
came to his christening and named him "Tom Thumb." She then dressed
him nicely in a shirt of spider's web, and a doublet and hose of
thistledown.
<p>
One day, while Tom's mother was making a plum-pudding, Tom stood on
the edge of the bowl, with a lighted candle in his hand, that she
might see to make it properly. Unfortunately, however, while her back
was turned, Tom fell into the bowl, and his mother not missing him,
stirred him up in the pudding, and put it and him into the pot. Tom
no sooner felt the hot water than he danced about like man; the woman
was nearly frightened out of her wits to see the pudding come out of
the pot and jump about, and she was glad to give it to a tinker who
was passing that way.
<p>
The tinker was delighted with his present; but as he was getting over
a style, he happened to sneeze very hard, and Tom called out from the
middle of the pudding, "Hallo, Pickens!" which so terrified the
tinker that he threw the pudding into the field, and scampered away
as fast as he could. The pudding tumbled to pieces in the fall, and
Tom, creeping out, went home to his mother, who was in great
affliction because she could not find him. A few days afterwards Tom
went with his mother into the fields to milk the cows, and for fear
he should be blown away by the wind, she tied him to a thistle with a
small piece of thread. Very soon after a cow ate up the thistle and
swallowed Tom Thumb. His mother was in sad grief again; but Tom
scratched and kicked in the cow's throat till she was glad to throw
him out of her mouth again.
<p>
One day Tom Thumb went ploughing with his father, who gave him a whip
made of barley straw, to drive the oxen with; but an eagle, flying
by, caught him up in his beak, and carried him to the top of a great
giant's castle. The giant would have eaten Tom up; but the fairy
dwarf scratched and bit his tongue and held on by his teeth till the
giant in a passion took him out again and threw him into the sea,
when a very large fish swallowed him up directly. The fish was caught
soon after and sent as a present to King Arthur, and when the cook
opened it there was Tom Thumb inside. He was carried to the king, who
was delighted with the little man.
<p>
The king ordered a little chair to be made, in order that Tom might
sit on his table, and also a palace of gold a span high, with a door
an inch wide, for little Tom to live in. He also gave him a coach
drawn by six small mice.
<p>
This made the queen angry, because she had no a new coach too;
therefore, resolving to ruin Tom, she complained to the king that he
had spoken insolently to her. The king sent for him. Tom, to escape
his fury, crept into an empty snail shell, and lay there till he was
almost starved; when peeping out of the shell he saw a fine butterfly
settled on the ground: he now ventured out, and getting on it, the
butterfly took wing, and mounted into the air with little Tom on his
back. Away he flew from field to field, from tree to tree, till at
last he flew to the king's court. The king, queen, and nobles all
strove to catch the butterfly but could not. At length poor Tom,
having neither bridle or saddle, slipped from his seat and fell into
a pool of water, where he was found nearly drowned. The queen vowed
he should be beheaded, and while the scaffold was getting ready, he
was secured in a mouse-trap; when the cat seeing something stir
supposing it to be a mouse, patted the trap about till she broke it,
and set Tom at liberty.
<p>
Sometimes Tom rode out on a mouse for a horse. One day a big black
met him along the road, and wanted to kill the mouse. Tom jumped off
the mouse's back, drew his sword, and fought the cat, and made her
run away.
<p>
In order to show his courage and please the queen, the new knight
undertook a terrible adventure.
<p>
In one corner of the palace garden there was found a great black
spider, of which the lady was very much afraid.
<p>
Tom undertook to kill this insect; so he took a gold button for a
shield, and his sharp needle-sword, and went out to attack the
spider; the knights went also, to witness the combat.
<p>
Tom drew his sword and fought valiantly, but the spider's poisonous
breath overcame him.
<p>
King Arthur and his whole Court went into mourning for little Tom
Thumb. They buried him under a rose-bush, and raised a nice white
marble monument over his grave.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The water he splashed all over the floor,<br>
Which ran downstairs, and one night made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A terrible slop at the parlour door.<br>
<p>
To give him advice was a waste of time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So his father resolved to try a stick,<br>
And never since then has he been called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dirty, noisy, mischievous Dick.<br>

Listen about a naughty boy<br>
Who might have been a parent's joy,<br>
But that he had a strong desire<br>
To always meddle with fire.<br>
<p>
One day when his mamma went out,<br>
She said "Mind, dear, what you're about:<br>
With your nice books and playthings stay,<br>
And with the fire, oh! do not play."<br>
<p>
But as soon as his mamma was gone,<br>

Now we'll have a glorious blaze.<br>

"No one is by, 't is quickly done,<br>
And oh! 't will be such famous fun."<br>
Quick then about the hearth he strewed<br>
Some scraps of paper and of wood.<br>
<p>
Then lighted them and drew them out,<br>
And with them, laughing, ran about.<br>
But soon he changed his merry note&mdash;<br>
The flames, alas, had caught his coat,<br>
And every moment, mounting higher,<br>
His body soon was all on fire;<br>
And though he screamed with shriek and shout,<br>
No one came near to put it out:<br>
So it happened, sad to say,<br>
That boy was burned to death that day.<br>

Willie was a spiteful boy,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Jumped upon their toys.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Boys, stop your noise! Girls, stop your jumping and

&nbsp;&nbsp;While I tell you about a bad boy, who often deserves
a whipping.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If this boy to you were named, to speak to him you'd
feel ashamed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So to-day I'll only say&mdash;He's a wicked, rude,

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't tell you his age, nor the colour of his hair,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor say anything about the clothes he sometimes does
wear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You never see them neat and clean, and seldom without
a tear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because&mdash;He's a wicked, rude, bad, naughty,
cross, nasty, bold, dirty-faced boy!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If he's sent on a message, such a long time he stops,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To pelt stones at Chinamen, and stare in the shops;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Running behind drays, and wastes time so many ways,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That when he gets home his mother says&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh you wicked, rude, bad, naughty, cross, nasty, bold,
dirty-faced boy!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If his mother gives him lolly, cake, piece of beef or
mutton,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a corner he'll eat it by himself, he's such a nasty,
greedy glutton.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he'll smug from his playmates a marble, top or
button,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That scarcely any one can with him have any fun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because&mdash;He's a wicked, rude, bad, naughty,
cross, nasty, bold, dirty-faced boy!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He's been going to school for years, I can't tell you
how long,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ask him to spell three words, two are sure to
be wrong;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you saw the dirty books and broken slate which to
him belong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You'd easily guess from such a mess that&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He's a wicked, rude, bad, naughty, cross, nasty, bold,
dirty-faced boy!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't believe a word he says, he tells so many
lies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He's such a coward, he'll only hit a girl or boy
much less than his size,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But if he gets a blow himself, he howls, bawls,
yelps, and cries,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That anyone who sees him never tries to please him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because&mdash;He's a wicked, rude, bad, naughty, cross,
nasty, bold, dirty-faced boy!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He won't play any game without being always cheating,

<center><b>Little Chinkey Chow-Chow<br></b>
(The Boy That Ran Away)<br></center>
<p>
There was a little Chinese Boy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That ran away from home&mdash;<br>
"Ha! ha!" he said, "I'll see the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the streets I'll roam.<br>
<p>
"I won't go any more to school,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or go so soon to bed,<br>
Nor yet be scolded if I choose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To stand upon my head."<br>
<p>
So little Chinkey ran away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His tail flew in the wind;<br>
He thought not of his good mamma<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was so very kind:<br>
<p>
He knew she could not follow him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the crowded street,<br>
Because mammas in China have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such very tiny feet.<br>
<p>
Now, as he went along he saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such strange and lovely sights,<br>
Such pretty painted houses&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such tops! and oh! such kites!<br>
<p>
He saw so many gilded toys,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and ivory things so white,<br>
That he forgot about the time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until he found it night.<br>
<p>
Ah! then he saw such fireworks!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They glistened in his eyes;<br>
The crackers and the lanterns too<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite took him by surprise.<br>
<p>
He listened to the music of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fiddle and the gong,<br>
And felt that it was jolly, though<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew that it was wrong.<br>
<p>
But after that he began to think<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Things were not so bright;<br>
The men were going, and there came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The watchman of the night;<br>
<p>
And sleep was stealing over him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He scarce could lift his head,<br>
So he lay on the cold, cold stones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which served him for a bed.<br>
<p>
Little Chinkey Chow-Chow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Woke up with early light,<br>
And wandered far away from where<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He passed the dreary night;<br>
<p>
He was so very worn and cold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sadly wanted food,<br>
So he sat upon a well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In not a pleasant mood.<br>
<p>
He saw the well was very deep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The water too was clear,<br>
And soon he saw a golden fish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That looked so very near.<br>
<p>
He stretched his hand to catch the fish;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But oh! how sad to tell,<br>
He tumbled over and he sank<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the bottom of the well.<br>
<p>
Some other boys were playing there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw him disappear,<br>
And ran along the road to see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone was near.<br>
<p>
A Great BIG Market Gardener,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was soon upon the ground,<br>
And caught our little Chinkey up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who soon would have been drowned.<br>
<p>
The boys began to jeer at him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he was very wet;<br>
They pulled his dripping tail, and called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Him names that I forget.<br>
<p>
One took his wooden shoes away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Another took his hat,<br>
And someone said, "It serves him right,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now only think of that!<br>
<p>
When little Chinkey ran away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His tail flew in the wind;<br>
But when our Chinkey turned again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His tail hung down behind.<br>
<p>
He wandered past the painted shops,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they put up the tea,<br>
And I am sure the boys at school<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were happier than he.<br>
<p>
Poor Chinkey Chow was very tired,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And very sore his feet,<br>
When his mother saw him from<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The corner of a street.<br>
<p>
She said he was a wicked boy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ought to have a smack!<br>
And yet I think she loved him more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she'd got him back.<br>
<p>
Now when I see a Chinaman,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is every day,<br>
I wonder if he is, grown up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy that ran away.<br>
<p>
But what I still think most about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When I this story tell,<br>
Is the GREAT BIG Market Gardener<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That raised him from the well<br>

<center><b>That Nice Boy</b></center><br>
<p>
"Nice child&mdash;very nice child," observed an old gentleman,
crossing
to the other side of the car and addressing the mother of the boy who
had just hit him in the eye with a wad of paper. "How old are you, my
son?"
<p>
"None of your business," replied the youngster, taking aim at another
passenger.
<p>
"Fine boy," smiled the old man, as the parent regarded her offspring
with pride. "A remarkably fine boy. What is your name, my son?"
<p>
"Puddin' Tame!" shouted the youngster, with a giggle at his own wit.
<p>
"I thought so," continued the old man, pleasantly. "If you had given
me three guesses at it, that would have been the first one I would
have struck on. Now, Puddin', you can blow those things pretty
straight, can't you?"
<p>
"You bet!" squealed the boy, delighted at the compliment. "See me
take that old fellow over there!"
<p>
"No, no!" exclaimed the old gentleman, hastily. "Try it on the old
woman I was sitting with. She has boys of her own, and she won't
mind."
<p>
"Can't you hit the lady for the gentleman, Johnny?" asked the fond
parent.
<p>
Johnny cleverly landed the pellet on the end of the old woman's nose.
<p>
But she did mind it, and rising in her wrath soared down on the small
boy like a hawk. She put him over the line, reversed him, ran him
backwards, till he didn't know which end of him was front, and
finally dropped him into the lap of the scared mother, with a
benediction whereof the purport was that she'd be back in a moment to
skin him alive.
<p>
"She didn't seem to like it, Puddin'," smiled the old gentleman,
softly. "She's a perfect stranger to me; but I understand she is the
matron of an Orphans' Home, and I thought she would like a little
fun; but I was mistaken."
<p>
And the old man smiled sweetly as he went back to his seat. He was
sorry for the poor little boy, but he couldn't help it.

Of all the small boys in our town<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Jones boy was the worst,<br>
And if the "bad man" came around<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd take that Jones boy first.<br>
<p>
One day he slipped away from home<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And went out for a skate<br>
Down on a deep and dangerous pond<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;They scraped along the ground;<br>
Beneath the water and the ice&mdash;<br>

<p>
At last their search was given up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until a thaw should come;<br>
The mother's sobs began afresh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sorrow was not dumb.<br>
<p>
They turned to leave the fatal pool,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice came clear and free&mdash;<br>
"Hallo! If you want Frankie Jones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll find him up this tree."<br>

<center><b>Cooley's Boy</b></center><br>
<p>
The boy not only preys on my melon-patch and fruit trees, and upon
those of my neighbours, but he has an extraordinary aptitude for
creating a disturbance in whatever spot he happens to be. Only last
Sunday he caused such a terrible commotion in church that the
services had to be suspended for several minutes until he could be
removed. The interior of the edifice was painted and varnished
recently, and I suppose one of the workers must have left a clot of
varnish upon the back of Cooley's pew, which is directly across the
aisle from mine. Cooley's boy was the only representative of the
family at church upon that day, and he amused himself during the
earlier portions of the service by kneeling upon the seat and
communing with Dr. Jones' boy, who occupied the pew immediately in
the rear. Sometimes, when young Cooley would resume a proper
position, Jones's boy would stir him up afresh by slyly pulling his
hair, whereupon Cooley would wheel about and menace Jones with his
fist in a manner which betrayed utter indifference to the proprieties
of the place and the occasion, as well as the presence of the
congregation. When Cooley finally sank into a condition of repose, he
placed his head, most unfortunately, directly against the lump of
undried varnish, while he amused himself by reading the commandments
and the other scriptural texts upon the wall behind the pulpit.
<p>
In a few moments he attempted to move, but the varnish had mingled
with his hair, and it held him securely. After making one or two
desperate but ineffectual efforts to release himself, he became very
angry; and supposing that Jones's boy was holding him, he shouted:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leg go o' my hair! Leg go o' my hair, I tell you!"
<p>
The clergyman paused just as he was entering upon consideration of
"secondly," and the congregation looked around in amazement, in time
to perceive young Cooley, with his head against the back of the pew,
aiming dreadful blows over his shoulder with his fist at some unseen
person behind him. And with every thrust he exclaimed:
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll smash yer nose after church! I'll go for you, Bill
Jones, when I ketch you alone! Leg go o' my hair, I tell you, or
I'll knock the stuffin' out o' yer," etc, etc.
<p>
Meanwhile, Jones's boy sat up at the very end of his pew, far away
from Cooley, and looked as solemn as if the sermon had made a deep
impression upon him.

"Do look at those pigs, as they lay in the straw,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Richard said to his papa;<br>
"They keep eating longer than ever I saw,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What nasty fat gluttons they are!"<br>
<p>
"I see they are feasting" his father replied,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"They eat a great deal I allow;<br>
But let us remember, before we deride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis the nature, my dear, of a sow.<br>
<p>
"But when a great boy, such as you, my dear Dick,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Does nothing but eat all day<br>
And keeps sucking things till he makes himself sick,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What a glutton! indeed, we may say.<br>
<p>
"When plumcake and sugar forever he picks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweetmeats, and comfits, and figs;<br>
Pray let him get rid of his own nasty tricks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he may laugh at the pigs."<br>

<p>
Never be dainty and throw food away;<br>
'Tis sinful, as you must have heard many say;<br>
Besides, you yourself may require food some day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though well fed.<br>
<p>
So don't smell your plate and turn over your food,<br>
And doubt if it's wholesome, or pleasant, or good;<br>
Such conduct is not only senseless,&mdash;but rude<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ill-bred.<br>
<p>
There was a young boy, who so dainty became,<br>
That whether his dinner was fish, flesh or game,<br>
He turned up his nose at them all, just the same,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would cry,<br>
<p>
"I cannot eat this,"&mdash;and, "I do not like
that;"&mdash;<br>
"This chicken's too lean,"&mdash;and "That mutton's too
fat;<br>
The dog he may eat it up all, or the cat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not I.<br>
<p>
The consequence was that he soon became thin;<br>
His bones they stuck out, and his cheeks they sunk in,<br>
And his hands were not stronger nor thicker than tin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so strong.<br>
<p>
And his legs grew as slender as little hat-pegs,<br>
And almost as small was his waist as his legs;<br>
And he looked like the laths that are fastened round
kegs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thin and long.<br>
<p>
And thinner, and thinner, and thinner he grew,<br>
A shadow had been rather fat, of the two;<br>
In fact, you might easily look him right through,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you tried.<br>
<p>
And when he was quite the skeleton grown,<br>
As weak as a reed, and as cold as a stone<br>
He fell all to pieces, and with a faint groan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So he died.<br>

<center><b>Declaration of a Distracted Schoolmaster.</b></center><br>
<p>
A year a go I took charge of a school of 1000 boys. They were a very
bad lot indeed, and I could do nothing with them. Being of a mild
disposition, I attempted to reason with them; but I might as well
have reasoned with the pigs. I then thought of punishing them, but
that was a big task, and, besides, what mode of punishment should I
adopt? In my utmost perplexity I wrote to Professor Wilderspin&mdash;a
great authority on the management of boys&mdash;and he wrote as
follows:
<p>
"Nearly all boys can be managed by an intelligent
schoolmaster<br>
without punishment, but in a few cases it seems
impossible to do<br>
without it. In every large school in England, Ireland,
and Scotland<br>
some corporal punishment is used, and some must continue
to be used<br>
as long as very vicious children continue to exist, or as
long as<br>
parents spoil their children by over indulgence or by
wilful<br>
criminal neglect before they send them to
school.&mdash;Yours truly,<br>
Professor Wilderspin."<br>
<p>
I then wrote to twenty-seven of the principal headmasters in the
world, and the following are the replies:&mdash;
<p>
From the High School of Eton wrote head-master, Mr.
Squeers:<br>
"If they don't behave as they should do, why, soundly box
their
ears."<br>
From the Grammar School of Harrow wrote head-master, Mr.
Phfool:<br>
"If they do not behave themselves, expel them from the
school."<br>
From the Training School of Rugby wrote head-master, Mr
Wist:<br>
"Just take a handful of their hair, and give a sharp,
short twist."<br>
From the College School of Oxford wrote Professor Rarey
Hook:<br>
"Instead of nearly killing, overawe them with a look."<br>
From the Bible School of Cambridge wrote Professor
William Brying:<br>
"Well whip them with a birchen rod, and never mind their
crying."<br>
From the Blue Coat School of London wrote Professor
Rupert Gower:<br>
"At arm's length make them hold a book the space of
half-an-hour."<br>
From the Naval School of Liverpool wrote head-master Mr.
Jointer:<br>
"Just rap them on the knuckles with a common teacher's
pointer."<br>
From the People's School of Manchester wrote head-master
Mr.
Flowers:<br>
"Make them kneel down as still as death for just about
two hours."<br>
From the Infant School of Birmingham wrote Professor Dory
Heller:<br>
"Just put on them a fool's cap, marked 'dunce,' 'thief,'
or
'story-teller'."<br>
From the Charity school of Sheffield wrote head-master,
Mr. Clay:<br>
"If the boys are disobedient, do not let them out to
play."<br>
From the Gentleman's School at Brighton wrote Professor
Robert
Flask:<br>
"If the boys will act unruly, why, just make them do a
task."<br>
From the National School of Bristol wrote Professor Mark
Groom:<br>
"If the boys are extra naughty, shut them in a dark
room."<br>
From the District School of Edenburgh wrote head-master,
Mr. Glass:<br>
"The naughty boys should all be sent to the bottom of the
class."<br>
From the Mixed School of Glasgow wrote Professor Duncan
Law:<br>
"To keep a proper kind of school, just use the
three-tailed taw."<br>
From the Latin School of Dublin wrote Professor Patrick
Clayrence:<br>
"If the boys are very bad boys, write a letter to their
parents."<br>
From the Mission School, Calcutta, wrote the Rev. Mr. Mac
Look:<br>
"Try them by a boy jury, write the verdict in a
black-book."<br>
From the Lyceum of New York wrote Professor Henry
Bothing:<br>
"Take your delinquent boys one hour and make them sit on
nothing."<br>
From the Public School, Chicago, wrote head-master, Mr.
Norrids:<br>
"If they will not behave themselves, why, just you slap
their
foreheads."<br>
From, the Academy of San Francisco wrote head-master, Mr.
Power:<br>
"Make them stoop and hold their fingers on the floor for
just an
hour."<br>
From the Mormon School of Utah wrote Professor Orson
Pratt:<br>
"First strip and make them fast, and then just use the
little cat."<br>
From the King's College, Lisbon, wrote Professor Don
Cassiers:<br>
"If you want to make them good boys, pull, pinch, and
twist their
ears."<br>
From the Cadet's School of Paris wrote Professor Monsieur
Sour:<br>
"Just make them hold their hands above their heads for
one full
hour."<br>
From the Royal School of Amsterdam wrote Professor Vander
Tooler:<br>
"If they will not behave themselves, just trounce them
with a
ruler."<br>
From the Model School of Pekin wrote Professor Cha Han
Coo:<br>
"Just put their hands into the stocks and beat with a
bamboo."<br>
From the Normal School of Moscow wrote Professor Ivan
Troute:<br>
"To make your boys the best of boys, why, just use the
knout."<br>
From the Muslim School of Cairo wrote the Mufti, Pasha
Saido:<br>
"Upon the bare soles of their feet give them the
bastinado."<br>
From the Common School of Berlin wrote Professor Von de
Rind:<br>
"There's nothing like the old, old way that ever could I
find;<br>
Just lay them right across your knee and cane them well
behind.<br>
I've only just been speaking mit mine goot frien', Doctor
Whistim,<br>
And he says that it does no harm, but is felt throughout
the
system."<br>
At last, as I was thinking deep how puzzling all this
looks,<br>
I received a tempting offer from a certain Mr. Snooks.<br>
His "great machine to whip with speed" I brought with
flusteration,<br>
But to see just how it did succeed you view the
illustration.<br>

Oh dear! what a beautiful doll<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My sister has bought at the fair<br>
She says I must call it Miss Poll,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And make it a bonnet to wear.<br>
<p>
Oh pretty new doll, it looks fine!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's cheeks are all covered with red.<br>
But pray will it always be mine?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And please may I take it to bed?<br>
<p>
How kind was my sister to buy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This dolly with hair that will curl;<br>
Perhaps, if you want to know why,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's because I've been a good girl.<br>

Now Puss had a doll<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Dame Trot bought to please her,<br>
And gave it the beautiful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Name of Louisa<br>
And when Kitty was lonesome<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or wanted to play,<br>
She'd cry for Loo! Loo!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a comical way.<br>
<p>
The dolly was petted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was kissed and caressed,<br>
Though often quite roughly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be confessed<br>
And so pleased was Miss Puss<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With Louisa's fair charms,<br>
She took her cat's meat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the doll in her arms<br>

<p>
'Tis very well to smile&mdash;now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But you gave me such a fright,<br>
When I missed you, darling Dolly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the middle of the night.<br>
<p>
I thought we played together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you fell into a stream;<br>
Yet I said&mdash;just half awaking&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tis nothing but a dream.<br>
<p>
"For safe upon my pillow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lies her curly golden hair,"<br>
Then I reached my hand to touch you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I couldn't find you there.<br>
<p>
I felt so sad and lonely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I cried, but all in vain;<br>
So to see if I could find you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I went off to sleep again.<br>
<p>
Now, fancy! in the morning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There you were, all safe and right;<br>
And nurse said, "Here's poor Dolly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Been upon the floor all night!"<br>
<p>
Your pretty curls are tangled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They were so nice and smooth before;<br>
So promise, Dolly darling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You will tumble out no more!<br>

I love my dear dolly;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll tell you her name,<br>
I called her "Sweet Polly"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The day that she came.<br>
<p>
My Uncle John brought her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From over the sea;<br>
And no one shall part us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My dolly and me.<br>
<p>
She has cheeks like red roses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And eyes blue and bright,<br>
That open with daylight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And close with the night.<br>
<p>
She cries, and says, "Mam-ma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mam-mam-ma," so well,<br>
That it is not a baby<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You scarcely can tell.<br>
<p>
You know, I'm her own ma;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A small one, you'll say,<br>
But just right for dolly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who wants nought but play.<br>
<p>
No teaching, no training,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Few clothes and no food;<br>
And I like being her ma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she's so good.<br>

Mamma, do send for Doctor Man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tell him to be quick,<br>
My dolly fell and broke her arm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So she is very sick.<br>
<p>
I thought that she was fast asleep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid her on her bed,<br>
But down she dropped upon the floor;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O dear! she's almost dead!<br>
<p>
Poor dolly! she was just as brave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And did not cry at all;<br>
Do you suppose she ever can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Get over such a fall?<br>
<p>
But when the doctor mends her arm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wraps it up so tight,<br>
Then I will be her little nurse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch her all the night.<br>
<p>
And if she only will get well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And does not lose her arm,<br>
I'll never let her fall again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor suffer any harm.<br>

I know a little girl who tried,<br>

In Bridget's great, big tub, and cried<br>

To find her own small dolly-tub,<br>

But naughty Sally shook her head<br>

You needn't be trying to comfort me&mdash;<br>

There's no use saying she isn't&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a crack like that on her head.<br>
It's just like you said it wouldn't hurt<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;My head off, you hadn't a word to say.<br>

You might make her look all mended&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what do I care for looks?<br>
Why, glue's for chairs and tables,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And toys, and the backs of books!<br>
<p>
My dolly! my own little daughter!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, but it's the awfullest crack!<br>
It just makes me sick to think of the sound<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When her poor head went whack<br>
Against this horrible brass thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That holds up the little shelf.<br>
Now, Nursey, what makes you remind me?<br>

What good would forty heads do her?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Her elegant New Year's hat!<br>
And I took a sweet ribbon of hers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;List night to tie on that horrid cat!<br>
<p>
When my mamma gave me that ribbon&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I was playing out in the yard&mdash;<br>
She said to me most expressly:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here's a ribbon for Hildegarde."<br>
And I went and put it on Tabby,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Hildegarde saw me do it;<br>
But I said to myself, "Oh, never mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't believe she knew it!"<br>
<p>
But I know that she knew it now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I just believe, I do,<br>
That her poor little heart was broken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so her head broke too.<br>
Oh, my baby! my little baby!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish my head had been hit!<br>
For I've hit it over and over,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And it hasn't cracked a bit.<br>
<p>
But since the darling is dead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She'll want to be buried of course;<br>
We will take my little wagon, Nurse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you shall be the horse;<br>
And I'll walk behind and cry;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we'll put her in this&mdash;you see,<br>
This dear little box&mdash;and we'll bury<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Them under the maple tree.<br>
<p>
And papa will make a tombstone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the one he made for my bird;<br>
And he'll put what I tell him on it&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, every single word!<br>
I shall say: "Here lies Hildegarde,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful doll that is dead;<br>
She died of a broken heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a dreadful crack in her head."<br>

<center><b>Christening Dolly</b></center><br>
<p>
See, this is my Christmas dolly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks ago she came;<br>
And, oh! the trouble I have had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To find a pretty name.<br>
<p>
At first I thought of Marguerite&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A French name, meaning "pearl"&mdash;<br>
But Nellie said, "Oh! that's too stiff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For such a graceful girl."<br>
<p>
And then I mentioned, one by one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Susanna, Ruth, and Poll,<br>
"But they are too old-fashioned names<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Nell, "to suit your doll."<br>
<p>
So the next day I got a great big book,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And searched it through and through,<br>
Then shook my head and sadly said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"There's not one name will do."<br>
<p>
My brother Tom was sitting near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his eyes and smiled;<br>
"Why, Pussy dear," he kindly said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Suppose I name your child."<br>
<p>
"Oh! will you Brother Tom?" I cried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I hugged him, so;  (hugging her
doll.)<br>
"We'll play you are the parson<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That christens folks, you know."<br>
<p>
So then, he took her in his arms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And solemnly and slow<br>
He said: "This baby's name shall be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Josephine, or Jo."<br>
<p>
And there, before I knew it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My baby had a name;<br>
And what I like about it, is,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That mine is just the same.<br>

Three little girls brought each a doll,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To pass an afternoon;<br>
The dresses all were soon displayed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their bangles made a tune;<br>
And when they parted to go home,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One young girl shrewdly said:<br>
"Our dollies have behaved real nice&mdash;<br>

Whenever I'm tired of reading,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or lonely in my play,<br>
I come to the window here, and watch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The little girl over the way.<br>
<p>
But she will not look nor listen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor stand for a moment still;<br>
And though I watch her the livelong day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm afraid she never will.<br>

For some day some one will buy her,<br>

<center><b>My Doll</b></center><br>
<p>
I found my old dolls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the attic to-day,<br>
In a box where I long ago<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid them away.<br>
It was silly, I know,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But 'twas such a surprise,<br>
The sight of their faces<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought tears to my eyes.<br>
<p>
There was poor little Flossie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With azure eyes closed.<br>
For many a month<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She had quietly dozed,<br>
In the little silk gown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In which I last dressed her&mdash;<br>
That time was brought back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So I stopped and caressed her;<br>
<p>
And then, as I raised her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened her eyes,<br>
And stared at her mother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In such sad surprise<br>
That I kissed her and laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her again in her place<br>
To keep her reproachful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue eyes off my face.<br>
<p>
And next I uncovered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My little bisque Mabel,<br>
To meet whose brown eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I was still more unable.<br>
There gaze was surprised,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But exceedingly mild,<br>
My poor little, dear little,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Led-away child!<br>
<p>
And I kissed her, her face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked so childish and sweet,<br>
And I held for a moment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her little kid feet,<br>
For her stockings were scattered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so were her shoes,<br>
And then, when I found them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They gave me the blues.<br>
<p>
I kissed her, and laid her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the box, but<br>
She looked at me still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(For her eyes would not shut)<br>
And hastily covering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face from my sight,<br>
I searched till wax Elsie<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I brought to the light.<br>
<p>
Now, that poor little doll<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was only my niece,<br>
Her eyes were dark blue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And her curls white as fleece<br>
But her nose was so flat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas no longer a nose,<br>
And her wax cheeks had faded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lost all their rose.<br>
<p>
From losing her sawdust<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her body was slender,<br>
Yet for those very reasons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My kiss was more tender,<br>
And I laid the poor thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Away with a sigh,<br>
And feeling, I must say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like having a cry.<br>
<p>
One big doll was missing,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Rosabel,&mdash;<br>
How much I did love her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I really can't tell.<br>
It is painful, indeed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be talking about,<br>
But I loved her so much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I quite wore her out.<br>
<p>
Well, well, I am older,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'm sure I'm not glad.<br>
The thought of those old times,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact makes me sad.<br>
And, although the feeling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is silly, I know,<br>
I cannot help sighing:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh! why did I grow?"<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>The Doll Show</b>
<p>
(For seven little girls&mdash;six with dolls. The seventh to be the
judge.)
<p>
<i>First girl enters, with doll in her arms.</i>
<p>
We're going to have a dolly show,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This very afternoon&mdash;<br>
The little girls will bring their dolls,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I think they'll be here soon),<br>
<p>
And then we'll have such lots of fun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll place them in a row,<br>
And the one the judge declares the best<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will take the prize, you know.<br>
<p>
My dolly is all ready,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've dressed her as a bride;<br>
Don't she look sweet; She'll take the prize,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of that I'm satisfied.<br>
<p>
<i>Places her doll on a bench or chair, and takes a seat.</i>
<p>
<i>Second Girl</i>
<p>
Oh, such a time as I have had,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought I would be late;<br>
I took so very, very long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To dress my little Kate,<br>
<p>
But here she is, my infant doll,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So white, and clean, and pure,<br>
Oh, yes, my precious darling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll take the prize, I'm sure.<br>
<p>
<i>Places doll next to doll No. 1 and takes a seat.</i>
<p>
<i>Third Girl&mdash;Carrying a handsome French Doll.</i>
<p>
My dolly came from Sunny France,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her name is Antoinette,<br>
She's two years old on Christmas day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she's my dearest pet.<br>
<p>
Her feet and hands are very small,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair is soft and light,<br>
Her eyes the deepest, darkest blue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And very large and bright.<br>
<p>
This handsome dress from Paris came,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Also this stylish hat,<br>
Why, she of course will take the prize,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm positive of that.<br>
<p>
<i>Places her doll by doll No. 2, and takes a seat.</i>
<p>
<i>Fourth Girl</i>
<p>
I hope they've saved a little space<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Jack, my sailor lad,<br>
The bravest, best, and nicest son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A mother ever had.<br>
<p>
He wears a suit of navy blue&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've brought him to the show<br>
Because he looks so very nice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll take the prize, I know.<br>
<p>
<i>Places it by doll No. 3, and sits down.</i>
<p>
<i>Fifth Girl&mdash;a very small girl holding by the arm a large rag
baby
with a long dress.</i>
<p>
My mamma's writing letters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And told me&mdash;"run away,"<br>
And so I brought my dolly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the baby show, to-day.<br>
<p>
She isn't very pretty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But she's very nice, I think,<br>
Her eyes, and nose, and little mouth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My mamma made with ink.<br>
<p>
I love my Dolly, 'cause she's good&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She never never cries,<br>
So don't you think she'll be the one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry off the prize?<br>
<p>
<i>Places her doll by doll No. 4, and takes a seat.</i>
<p>
<i>Sixth Girl</i>
<p>
They mustn't crowd my baby out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she's black as night.<br>
I think she'll stand as good a chance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As babies that are white.<br>
<p>
She's very neat, and nice, and clean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lips are cherry red,<br>
She wears a gay bandanna<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tied round her curly head.<br>
<p>
She's a very handsome lady,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if the judge be wise,<br>
I do not have the slightest doubt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That she will take the prize.<br>
<p>
<i>Places her doll by doll No. 5, and sits down.</i>
<p>
<i>First Girl&mdash;to the girls</i>
<p>
Do not open your mouths,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor shut your eyes!<br>
For here comes the judge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To award the prize.
<p>
<i>Seventh Girl&mdash;Enters carrying a wand. She views each doll in
turn
with critical eyes, then pointing to the first doll, says&mdash;</i>
<p>
Number one is very pretty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think she's rather tall.<br>
<p>
<i>Points to No. 2</i>
<p>
And this cunning little baby,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is a little bit too small.<br>
<p>
<i>No. 3</i>
<p>
Number three&mdash;a fine French lady,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Too Frenchy is, I fear.<br>
<p>
<i>Points to No. 4</i>
<p>
And Master Jack, I like your looks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think you dress too queer.<br>
<p>
<i>No. 5</i>
<p>
And this old-fashioned baby doll,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess lived in the ark;<br>
<p>
<i>No. 6</i>
<p>
No, no, Miss Dinah, no prize for you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your skin is much too dark.<br>
<p>
<i>Then turning to the little girls, she continues:</i>
<p>
And now, dear anxious mothers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I find I can't decide<br>
Which doll shall have the premium,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'll be satisfied<br>
<p>
If you'll call another meeting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow afternoon,<br>
I need more time to settle this&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To-day is much too soon.<br>
<p>
So, mothers, now I give these babies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Back to your loving care;<br>
And I thank you much for bringing them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To our famous Baby Fair.<br>
<p>
<i>Hands each doll to it's owner.</i>
<p>
<i>Exit all.</i>

<p>
The Sandwich Isles we visited,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where grew such radiant flowers,<br>
And pretty girls danced all the day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In fragrant, rosy bowers.<br>
<p>
We crossed the Equatorial Seas,<br>
&nbsp;And, sailing round and round<br>
The lovely islands of the main,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet coral groves we found.<br>
<p>
New Zealand's shores we landed at,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The country of strange things&mdash;<br>
Cherries that carried the stones out-side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowers with butterflies' wings.<br>
<p>
Oh, when we reach Australia&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What heaps and heaps of gold!<br>
And a million sheep and lambs we saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Straying from fold to fold.<br>
<p>
To buy some tea-pots and some trays,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We called at quaint Japan,<br>
Where a very polite old Japanese<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave Dolly an ivory fan.<br>
<p>
We took a trip to Chinese land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To take a cup of tea,<br>
But neither sugar nor cream was given,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which didn't suit Dolly and me.<br>
<p>
Then travelling to Hindustan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We met a tiger there,<br>
Who looked as though he would eat us up&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So off we flew elsewhere.<br>
<p>
And found ourselves in the Khyber Pass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of a Caravan,<br>
With which we travelled night and day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach Afghanistan.<br>
<p>
Across the Red Sea next we sail'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the Suez Canal,<br>
To purchase a camel at old Cairo,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a trot most magical,<br>
<p>
Across the Desert we rode apace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No water was there to drink,<br>
Ah, oh!&mdash;while climbing a Pyramid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolly dropped down a chink.<br>
<p>
An Arab kindly rescued her&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(She did so ruffle her hair;<br>
If ever she plays that trick again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She'll have to be left down there.)<br>
<p>
At last we left the Desert drear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To sail upon the Nile,<br>
In the Pasha's beautiful diabeheh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Past many a crocodile.<br>
<p>
We saw no end of wonders now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Africa's strange land&mdash;<br>
Forests full of lions fierce,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a savage band.<br>
<p>
Our steamer on the Congo sank&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We were in a dreadful plight<br>
Until we met with Stanley true,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then we steered aright.<br>
<p>
We said good-bye to Africa,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, though winds proved contrary,<br>
Northward our wondrous way we took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Isles of sweet Canary.<br>
<p>
Thence favouring gales conveyed us far<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond the Spanish shore;<br>
Fast by the coast of France we sped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To our own land once more.<br>
<p>
And now we're safe at home again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wise as wise can be;<br>
For seeing all the world's wonders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Improves my Doll and me.<br>

<center><b>The Story of a Doll</b></center><br>
<p>
I stood in the semi-darkness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And watched a child at her play;<br>
Her cares were of multiform nature,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the daylight was speeding away.<br>
<p>
Her dolly demanded attention,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be petted and kissed and be fed;<br>
To have on its little nightgown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then to be put in its bed.<br>
<p>
All this with a motherly yearning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She had learned by the instinct of love;<br>
And the dolly but faintly presented<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A gift from the heaven above.<br>
<p>
The dear little creature had finished<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And was just about turning to go,<br>
When the scene all changed in a moment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned into weeping and woe.<br>
<p>
A boy, almost reaching to manhood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dashed wildly from the room,<br>
And seizing the doll from the cradle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushed out again into the gloom.<br>
<p>
There was one wild scream from the maiden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A clasp of the hands and a chase;<br>
But the boy thought the thing was funny<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And was in for a brotherly race.<br>
<p>
But soon, when the screaming was louder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he saw all the pain he had caused.<br>
He threw down the doll on the flooring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sneering, he suddenly paused.<br>
<p>
"I wouldn't be such a cry-baby," he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a half-mocking drawl;<br>
"I can buy plenty more that's just like it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's only a plaster doll.<br>
<p>
"Why don't you get one made of china,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of that plaster thing?<br>
An then I would try to respect it,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he took himself off with a fling.<br>
<p>
"Oh, my dolly, my dolly is broken,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And quick in her bosom she hid<br>
The maimed little bit of her sunshine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I Loved it, I loved it, I did.<br>
<p>
"I don't care if it was only plaster;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas my dolly, my dolly, my own."<br>
And she knelt by the mangled plaything.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And now I am left all alone."<br>
<p>
Ten years from that very evening,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood by the couch of a child,<br>
While a man knelt and wept beside it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a face both haggard and wild.<br>
<p>
'Twas the old scene of the dolly repeated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy had to manhood grown;<br>
A hand crushed his plaster idol<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And left him to mourn all alone.<br>
<p>
Ah me! how the world is repeated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The work of each day o'er and o'er.<br>
We all have our broken dollies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Away on the golden shore.<br>
Did he think, I wonder, of that one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He threw on the carpetless floor.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<center><b>I am homesick, Dolly Dear</b></center><br>
<p>
Dolly knows what's the matter&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dolly and I.<br>
It isn't the mumps nor the measles&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! dear, I shall die!<br>
It's the mothering we want, Dolly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The&mdash;what shall I call it?<br>
And grandpa says he has sent&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He put the 'spatch safe in his wallet.<br>
<p>
I know well enough that he dropped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That telegraph 'spatch in the fire,<br>
If mother just knew, she'd come<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If 'twas on the telegraph wire!<br>
She'd take my poor head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is splitting this very minute,<br>
And she'd sing "There's a Happy Land,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hymn that has "Darling" in it.<br>
<p>
Course, I like grandpa's house;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's the splendidest place to stay,<br>
When there's all the outdoors to live in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing to do but to play;<br>
Somehow you forget your mother&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is, just the littlest bit,<br>
Though if she were here, I suppose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I shouldn't mention it.<br>
<p>
But oh! there's a difference, Dolly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When your head is so full of pains<br>
That ('cepting the ache that's in 'em)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There's nothing left of your brains,<br>
Remember how nice it feels, Dolly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To have your head petted and "poored."<br>
Ache? Why I ache all over,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my bed is as hard as a board.<br>
<p>
Nurse says "It's a sweet, lovely morning."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It may be for all that I care;<br>
There's just one spot in this great wide world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is pretty&mdash;I wish I was there!<br>
I can see the white roses climbing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All over the low porch door,<br>
And the daisies and buttercups growing&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I never half loved them before.<br>
<p>
And mother&mdash;let's see! she's standing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In that very same door, no doubt;<br>
She loves to look out in the morning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And see what the world is about,<br>
In a pale-blue something-or-other&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A loose sort of wrapper, I guess;<br>
As if a few yards of sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been taken to make a dress.<br>
<p>
And up from the pine woods yonder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes a beautiful woodsy smell,<br>
And the breeze keeps a hinting of May flowers&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The real-pink arbutus bell;<br>
And I think most likely the robins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have built in the cherry tree;<br>
And by and by there'll be birdies&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I shall not be there to see!<br>
<p>
Did you hear any noise, Dolly!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak, Dolly, you little witch!<br>
As if someone was laughing&mdash;or crying!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I couldn't tell which!<br>
We've kept from crying, so far;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We've choked but we wouldn't cry;<br>
I've just talked it out to you, dear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to, or else I'd die.<br>
<p>
But if that is you, mother&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I know by your lips that it is&mdash;<br>
I'll just squeeze your head off!&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You think that all I want is a kiss!<br>
O mother! to papa and Tom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You needn't got mention it,<br>
But you know it was homesickness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost killed your poor little Kit!<br>

<p>
Two naughty little people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a quarrel one sad day,<br>
Each said that with the other,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She never more would play.<br>
<p>
And so upon each other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their little backs they turned,<br>
And all the old time fondness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! they coldly spurned.<br>
<p>
But oh! their angry hearts grew weary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The anger died away,<br>
Each hoped that soon the other<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would have a word to say.<br>
<p>
Each waited, oh! how sadly!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each moved a little near,<br>
And each "around the corner"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Began, at last, to peer.<br>
<p>
Then Nellie held her dolly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Annie with a smile:<br>
"You may have it if you want to.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An play with it awhile."<br>
<p>
Then Annie quickly followed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rule she knew was right:<br>
"I've got an apple, Nellie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll give you a big bite."<br>
And somehow the sweet faces<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Met fair and square at last,<br>

<center><b>A New Year's Gift</b></center><br>
<p>
A charming present comes from town,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A baby-house quite neat;<br>
With kitchen, parlours, dining-room,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And chambers, all complete.<br>
<p>
A gift to Emma and to Rose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From grandpa it came;<br>
The little Rosa smil'd delight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Emma did the same.<br>
<p>
They eagerly examin'd all&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The furniture was gay;<br>
And in the rooms they plac'd their dolls,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When dress'd in fine array.<br>
<p>
At night, their little candles lit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as they must be fed,<br>
To supper down the dolls were plac'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then were put to bed.<br>
<p>
Thus Rose and Emma pass'd each hour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Devoted to their play;<br>
And long were cheerful, happy, kind&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No cross disputes had they.<br>
<p>
Till Rose in baby-house would change<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The chairs which were below<br>
"This carpet they would better suit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I'll have it so."<br>
<p>
"No, no indeed," her sister said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm older, Rose, than you;<br>
And I'm the pet&mdash;the house is mine:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss, what I say is true."<br>
<p>
The quarrel grew to such a height,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mamma she heard the noise,<br>
And coming in, beheld the floor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All strew'd with broken toys.<br>
<p>
"O fie, my Emma! naughty Rose!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Say, why this sulk and pout?<br>
Remember this is New Year's Day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And both are going out."<br>
<p>
Now Betty calls the little girls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To come upstairs and dress:<br>
They still revile, with threats<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And angry rage express.<br>
<p>
But just prepar'd to leave their room,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Persisting yet in strife,<br>
Rose sick'ning fell on Betty's lap.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As void of sense or life.<br>
<p>
Mamma appear'd at Betty's call&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;John for the doctor goes;<br>
The measles, he begins to think,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dread symptoms all disclose.<br>
<p>
"But though I stay, my Emma, you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May go and spend the day."<br>
"O no, mamma," replied the child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Do suffer me to stay.<br>
<p>
"Beside my sister's bed I'll sit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch her with such care,<br>
"No pleasure can I e'er enjoy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till she my pleasure share.<br>
<p>
"How silly now seems our dispute,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one of us she knows;<br>
How pale she looks, how hard she breathes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor pretty little Rose!"<br>

<center><b>Anger</b></center><br>
<p>
Oh! anger is an evil thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And spoils the fairest face;<br>
It cometh like a rainy cloud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon a sunny place.<br>
<p>
One angry moment often does<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What we repent for years:<br>
It works the wrong we ne'er make right<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By sorrow or tears.<br>
<p>
It speaks the rude and cruel word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That wounds a feeling breast:<br>
It strikes the reckless sudden blow&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It breaks the household rest.<br>
<p>
We dread the dog that turns in play,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All snapping, fierce and quick;<br>
We shun the steed whose temper shows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In strong and savage kick.<br>
<p>
But how much more we find to blame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When passion wildly swells<br>
In hearts where kindness has been taught,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And brains where reason dwells!<br>
<p>
The hand of peace is frank and warm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And soft as a ring-dove's wing;<br>
And he who quells an angry thought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is greater than a king.<br>
<p>
Shame to the lips that ever seek<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To stir up jarring strife,<br>
When gentleness would shed so much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Christian joy through life!<br>
<p>
Ever remember in thy youth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he who firmly tries<br>
To conquer an to rule himself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is noble, brave and wise.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Dick Snappy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was always unhappy<br>
Because he did nothing but fret;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he once cried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas in vain that you tried<br>
To make him his troubles forget.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother once brought him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A drum, which she bought him<br>
Hard by at a neighbouring fair,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;To Edward his brother,<br>
And left them their pleasures to share.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Edward began,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a nice little man,<br>
To play with his little new drum;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Dick, with a pout,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only turned his about<br>
In his hands, and looked sulky and glum.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"What's the matter, dear Dick?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You look sad; are you sick?<br>
Come, march like a soldier with me:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The enemy comes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us beat on our drums,<br>
And mamma will out merriment see."<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"No! I don't like my new toy,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said my ill-humoured boy,<br>
"And yours is the best and most new;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you'll give me yours,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I'll go out of doors;<br>
But if not, I'll kick mine in two."<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Oh no! brother, no&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray do not say so<br>
Of a trifle, in anger and haste;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they are equally new,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet my drum I'll give you,<br>
But I've tied it in knots round my waist."<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then quarrelsome Dick<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave his brother a kick;<br>
But he did not give him another,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But, saying no more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward walked to the door,<br>
Only giving one look at his brother.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, bursting with spite,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his utmost of might<br>
Master Dick trod his drum on the floor;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The parchment did crack,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When lo; Edward comes back,<br>
And his drum in his hands then he bore.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The string is untied,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dearest brother," he cried&mdash;<br>
"So now I with pleasure will change;"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when Dick's drum he found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying broke on the ground,<br>
Oh! how did his countenance change.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm really ashamed,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dick, sobbing, exclaimed,<br>
"At the difference between you and me;<br>

<center><b>Where Do You Live</b></center><br>
<p>
I knew a man, and his name was Horner,<br>
He used to live at Grumble Corner,&mdash;<br>
Grumble Corner, in Cross Patch Town,&mdash;<br>
And he never was seen without a frown.<br>
He grumbled at this, he grumbled at that;<br>
He growled at the dog, he growled at the cat;<br>
He grumbled at morning, he grumbled at night,<br>
And to grumble and growl was his chief delight.<br>
<p>
He grumbled so much at his wife, that she<br>
Began to grumble as well as he;<br>
And all the children wherever they went<br>
Reflected their parents' discontent.<br>
If the sky was dark and betokened rain,<br>
Then Mr. Horner was sure to complain;<br>
And if there was never a cloud about,<br>
He'd grumble because of threatened drought.<br>
<p>
One day, as I loitered along the street,<br>
My old acquaintance I chanced to meet.<br>
Whose face was without the look of care<br>
And the ugly frown it used to wear.<br>
"I may be mistaken, perhaps," I said.<br>
As, after saluting, I turned my head;<br>
"But it is, and it isn't, the Mr. Horner<br>
Who lived so long at Grumble Corner."<br>
<p>
I met him next day, and I met him again,<br>
In melting weather, in pouring rain;<br>
When stocks were up and when stocks were down;<br>
But a smile, somehow, had replac'd the frown.<br>
It puzzled me much, and so, one day,<br>
I seized his hand in a friendly way,<br>
And said "Mr. Horner, I'd like to know<br>
What can have happened to change you so."<br>
<p>
He laughed a laugh that was good to hear,<br>
For it told of a conscience calm and clear,<br>
And he said, with none of the old-time drawl,<br>
"Why, I've changed my residence, that is all."<br>
"Changed your residence?" "Yes," said Horner,<br>
"It wasn't healthy at Grumble Corner,<br>
And so I've moved: 'twas a change complete;<br>
And you'll find me now at Thanksgiving Street."<br>
<p>
And every day, as I move along<br>
The streets, so filled with busy throng,<br>
I watch each face, and can always tell<br>
Where men, and women, and children dwell.<br>
And many a discontented mourner<br>
Is spending his days at Grumble Corner,<br>
Sour and sad, whom I long to entreat<br>
To take a house in Thanksgiving Street.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Come, come, Mr. Peacock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must not be so proud,<br>
Although you can boast such a train,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Far more highly endowed,<br>
And not half so conceited and vain.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you, gay bird,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That a suit of fine clothes<br>
Is a sorry distinction at most,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seldom much valued<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excepting by those<br>
Who only such graces can boast.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The nightingale certainly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wears a plain coat,<br>
But she cheers and delights with her song;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While you, though so vain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot utter a note<br>
To please by the use of your tongue.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hawk cannot boast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a plumage so gay,<br>
But more piercing and clear is her eye;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And while you are strutting<br>

She gallantly soars in the sky.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dove may be clad<br>

With a large little party<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ev'ning to spend.<br>
<p>
"Ah! how they will all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be delighted, I guess,<br>
And stare with surprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At my elegant dress!"<br>
Thus said the vain girl,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And her little heart beat,<br>
Impatient the happy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Young party to meet.<br>
<p>
But, alas! they were all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To intent on their fun,<br>
To observe the gay clothes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This fine lady had on;<br>
And thus all her trouble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite lost its design,<br>
For they saw she was proud,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But forgot she was fine.<br>
<p>
'Twas Lucy, tho' only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In simple white clad,<br>
(Nor trimmings, nor laces,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor jewels she had,)<br>
Whose cheerful good nature<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Delighted them more,<br>
Than all the fine garments<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Harriet wore.<br>
<p>
'Tis better to have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sweet smile on one's face,<br>
Than to wear a rich frock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With an elegant lace,<br>
For the good-natur'd girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is lov'd best in the main,<br>
If her dress is but decent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' ever so plain.<br>

Little Tommy, and Peter, and Archie, and Bob<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were walking, one day, when they found<br>
An apple: 'twas mellow, and rosy, and red,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lying alone on the ground.<br>
<p>
Said Tommy: "I'll have it."  Said peter: "'Tis mine."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Archie: "I've got it; so there!"<br>
Said Bobby: "Now, let us divide it in four parts<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And each of us boys have a share."<br>
<p>
"No, no!" shouted Tommy, "I'll have it myself."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Peter: "I want it, I say."<br>
Said Archie: "I've got it, and I'll have it all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't give a morsel away."<br>
<p>
Then Tommy he snatched it, and Peter he fought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;('Tis sad and distressing to tell!)<br>
And Archie held on with his might and his main,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till out from his fingers it fell.<br>
<p>
Away from the quarrelsome urchins it flew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, down a green little hill<br>
That apple it roll'd, and it roll'd, and it roll'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if it would never be still.<br>
<p>
A lazy old brindle was nipping the grass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And switching her tail at the flies,<br>
When all of a sudden the apple rolled down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stopped just in front of her eyes.<br>
<p>
She gave but a bite and a swallow or two&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That apple was seen nevermore!<br>
"I wish," whimpered Archie, and Peter, and Tom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"We'd kept it and cut it in four."<br>

Little Mary one day most loudly did call,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mamma! oh, mamma, pray come here!<br>
A fall I have had&mdash;oh! a very sad fall."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mamma ran in haste and in fear;<br>
Then Mary jump'd up, and she laugh'd in great glee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And cried, "Why, how fast you can run!<br>
No harm has befallen, I assure you, to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My screaming was only in fun."<br>
<p>
Her mother was busy at work the next day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard from without a loud cry,<br>
"The big dog has got me! O help me! Oh! pray!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He tears me&mdash;he bites me&mdash;I
die!"<br>
Mamma, all in terror, quick to the court<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there little Mary she found;<br>
Who, laughing, said, "Madam, pray how do you do!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And curtsey'd quite down to the ground.<br>
<p>
That night little Mary, when long gone to bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrill cries and loud shriekings were
heard;<br>
"I'm on fire, O mamma, come up or I'm dead!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mamma she believ'd not a word.<br>
"Sleep, sleep, naughty child," she call'd out from
below,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"How often have I been deceived?<br>
You're telling a story, you very well know:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to sleep, for you can't be believed."<br>
<p>
Yet still the child scream'd&mdash;now the house fill'd
with smoke.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That fire is above Jane declares.<br>
Alas! Mary's words they soon found were no joke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When ev'ryone hastened upstairs.<br>
All burnt and all seam'd is her once pretty face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And how terribly mark'd are her arms,<br>
Her features all scarr'd, leave a lasting disgrace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For giving Mamma false alarms.<br>

That God who saw the thing she did,<br>
From whom no action can be hid;<br>
Did she forget that God could see,<br>

He made you eyes and can discern<br>
Whichever way you think to turn;<br>
He made your ears, and He can hear<br>

And always be afraid, my dear,<br>

I wish, my dear, you'd always try<br>

Tell me you're sorry, and you'll try<br>
To act the better by and bye,<br>
And then whate'er your crime has been,<br>
It won't be half so great a sin.<br>

But cheerful, innocent, and gay,<br>
As passes by the smiling day,<br>
You'll never have to turn aside,<br>
From any one your faults to hide;<br>
Nor heave a sigh, nor have a fear,<br>
That either God or I should hear.<br>

<center><b>The Work-bag</b></center><br>
<p>
To Jane her aunt a work-bag gave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of silk with flowers so gay,<br>
That she a place might always have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To put her work away.<br>
<p>
And then 'twas furnished quite complete<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With cotton, silk and thread,<br>
And needless in a case so neat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the sizes made.<br>
<p>
A little silver thimble, too,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there among the rest;<br>
And a large waxen doll, quite new,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That waited to be dress'd.<br>
<p>
But Jane was very fond of play,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And loved to toss her ball;<br>
An I am quite ashamed to say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She scarcely worked at all.<br>
<p>
But if at any time she did,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas but a stitch or two;<br>
And though she often has been bid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But little more would do.<br>
<p>
The pretty little bag, indeed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hung upon her chair;<br>
But cotton, needles, silk, and thread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were scattered here and there.<br>
<p>
Her aunt, by chance, came in that day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And asked if the doll was dress'd;<br>
Miss Jane has been engaged in play,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And careless of the rest.<br>
<p>
The silk, to make her little dress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was on the table laid,<br>
And, with an equal carelessness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The cap had also strayed.<br>
<p>
With gauze and lace the floor was strewed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All in disorder lay,<br>
When, bounding in with gesture rude,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Came Jane, returned from play.<br>
<p>
She little thought her aunt to find,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And blushed to see her there;<br>
It brought her carelessness to mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And what her doll should wear.<br>
<p>
"Well, Jane, and where's your doll, my dear?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you've dress'd her now;<br>
But there is such a litter here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You best know when and how."<br>
<p>
So spoke her aunt, and, looking round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The empty bag she spied;<br>
Poor Jane, who no excuse had found,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now hid her face and cried.<br>
<p>
"Since," said her aunt, "no work, you do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But waste your time in play;<br>
The work-bag, of no use to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I now shall take away."<br>
<p>
But now, with self-conviction, Jane<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her idleness confessed,<br>
And ere her aunt could come again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her doll was neatly dressed.<br>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When Harry and Dick<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been striving to please,<br>
Their father (to whom it was known)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Made two little gardens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stocked them with trees,<br>
And gave one to each for his own.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Harry thank'd his papa,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with rake, hoe, and spade,<br>
Directly began his employ;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon such a neat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little garden was made,<br>
That he panted with labour and joy.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There was always some bed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or some border to mend,<br>
Or something to tie or stick:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Harry rose early<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His garden to tend,<br>
While snoring lay indolent Dick.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The tulip, the rose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lily so white,<br>
United their beautiful bloom!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And often the honey-bee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stoop'd from his flight,<br>
To sip the delicious perfume.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A neat row of peas<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In full blossom was seen,<br>
French beans were beginning to shoot!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his gooseb'ries and currents,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' yet they were green,<br>
Foretold of plenty of fruit.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Richard loved better<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In bed to repose,<br>
And snug as he curl'd himself round,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgot that not tulip,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor lily, nor rose,<br>
Nor plant in his garden was found.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rank weeds and tall nettles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disfigur'd his beds,<br>
Nor cabbage nor lettuce was seen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The slug and the snail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Show'd their mischievous heads,<br>
And eat ev'ry leaf that was green.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus Richard the idle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shrank from the cold,<br>
Beheld his trees naked and bare;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst Harry the active<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was charmed to behold<br>
The fruit of his patience and care.<br>

<center><b>Lazy Sam</b></center><br>
<p>
There was a lazy boy named Sam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The laziest ever known,<br>
Who spent his time in idleness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any other drone.<br>
He loved to lie in bed till noon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With covers closely drawn,<br>
And when he managed to get up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd yawn, and yawn, and yawn.<br>
<p>
If asked to do a simple task<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He always would refuse,<br>
And say that he was lame or sick,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His action to excuse,<br>
And over pretty picture-books&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Twas really very odd&mdash;<br>
This lazy boy would soon begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To nod, and nod, and nod.<br>
<p>
If on an errand forced to go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd slowly, slowly creep,<br>
Just like a snail; you might suppose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he was half asleep.<br>
And those who would despatch in haste<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A note, or telegram,<br>
Would chose a swifter messenger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than such a lazy Sam.<br>
<p>
If he was caught out in a storm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twould drench him to the skin,<br>
Because he was too indolent<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hurry to get in.<br>
Deep in his trouser's pockets he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His idle hands would cram,<br>
And children crowded to the doors<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To look at lazy Sam.<br>
<p>
This lazy boy would lounge about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The docks, and often wish<br>
That he could carry home to cook<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A string of nice, fresh fish;<br>
But though he was provided with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A reel extremely fine,<br>
Said Sam "I do not think 'twill pay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To wet my fishing line!"<br>
<p>
Oh, Sam was always late at meals,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And always late at school,<br>
And everybody said that he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would be a first-class fool.<br>
For boys not half so old as he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Above him swiftly pass,<br>
While Sam, the great big dunce! remains<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lowest in the class.<br>
<p>
In every way, and every day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This lazy boy would shirk,<br>
And never lift his hand to do<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A bit of useful work.<br>
His clothes were always on awry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His shoe-strings left untied,<br>
His hair uncombed, his teeth uncleaned,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, he had no pride!<br>
<p>
And so he went from bad to worse&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The good-for-nothing scamp!&mdash;<br>
Until he settled down to be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A ragged, dirty tramp.<br>
Through cities, towns, and villages,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He begged his daily bread,<br>
And slept at night wherever he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Could chance to find a bed.<br>
<p>
Men shuddered as they passed him by,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And murmured sadly, "Oh!<br>
How can a human being sink<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So very, very low?"<br>
And e'en the jackass pricks his ears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And brays aloud "I am<br>

Oh! Willie is a lazy boy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A "Sleepy Head" is he,<br>
"Wake up!" his little sister cries,<br>

The birds are singing in the trees,<br>

Oh! lazy boys will never grow<br>

<p>
The lazy boy! and what's his name?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I should not like to tell;<br>
But don't you think it is a shame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he can't read or spell.<br>
<p>
He'd rather swing upon a gate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or paddle in a brook,<br>
Than take his pencil and his slate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or try to con a book.<br>
<p>
There, see! he's lounging down the street,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His hat without a brim,<br>
He rather drags than lifts his feet&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His face unwashed and grim.<br>
<p>
He's lolling now against a post;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you've seen him once,<br>
You'll know the lad among a host<br>
&nbsp;For what he is&mdash;a dunce.<br>
<p>
Don't ask me what's the urchin's name;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not choose to tell;<br>

'Tis the voice of the sluggard;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard him complain,<br>
"You have waked me too soon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I must slumber again."<br>
As the door on it's hinges,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So he on his bed<br>
Turns his sides, and his shoulders,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his heavy head.<br>
<p>
"A little more sleep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a little more slumber;"<br>
Thus he wastes half his days<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his hours without number,<br>
And when he gets up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He sits folding his hands,<br>
Or walking about sauntering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or trifling he stands.<br>
<p>
I pass'd by his garden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw the wild brier,<br>
The thorn and the thistle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grow broader and higher;<br>
The clothes that hung on him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are turning to rags,<br>
And his money still wastes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he starves or he begs.<br>
<p>
I made him a visit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still hoping to find<br>
That he took better care<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For improving his mind;<br>
He told me his dreams,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Talked of eating and drinking,<br>
But he scarce reads his Bible,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never loves thinking.<br>
<p>
Said I then to my heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Here's a lesson for me;<br>
This man's but a picture<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what I might be;<br>
But thanks to my friends<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For their care in my breeding,<br>
Who taught me bedtimes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To love working and reading."<br>

John Brown is a man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without houses or lands,<br>
Himself he supports<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the work of his hands.<br>
He brings home his wages<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Saturday night,<br>
To his wife and his children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A very good sight.<br>
<p>
His eldest boy, Dicky,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On errands when sent,<br>
To loiter and chatter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was very much bent;<br>
The neighbours all call'd him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An odd little trout,<br>
His shoes they were broke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his toes they peep'd out.<br>
<p>
To see such old shoes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All their sorrows were rife;<br>
John Brown he much grieved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so did his wife,<br>
He kiss'd his boy Dicky,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stroked his white head,<br>
"You shall have a new pair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear boy," he then said.<br>
<p>
"I've here twenty shillings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And money has wings;<br>
Go first get this note changed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I want other things."<br>
Now here comes the mischief&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This Dicky would stop<br>
At an ill-looking, mean-looking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Greengrocer's shop.<br>
<p>
For here lived a chattering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunce of a boy;<br>
To prate with this urchin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave Dicky great joy.<br>
And now, in his boasting,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He shows him his note,<br>
And now to the green-stall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Up marches a goat.<br>
<p>
The laughed, for it was<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This young nanny-goat's way<br>
With those who pass'd by her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To gambol and play.<br>
All three they went on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In their frolicsome bouts,<br>
Till Dick dropt the note<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On a bunch of green sprouts.<br>
<p>
Now what was Dick's wonder<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the vile goat,<br>
In munching the green sprouts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eat up his bank note!<br>
He crying ran back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To John Brown with the news,<br>
And by stopping to idle<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He lost his new shoes.<br>

Dick Dawdle had land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Worth two hundred a year,<br>
Yet from debt and from dunning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He never was free,<br>
His intellect was not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprisingly clear,<br>
But he never felt satisfied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How it could be.<br>
<p>
The raps at his door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rings at his gate.<br>
And the threats of a gaol<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer could bear:<br>
So he made up his mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To sell half his estate,<br>
Which would pay all his debts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And leave something to spare.<br>
<p>
He leased to a farmer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of his land<br>
For twenty-one years;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And on each quarter-day<br>
The honest man went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his rent in his hand,<br>
His liberal landlord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Delighted to pay.<br>
<p>
Before half the term<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lease had expired,<br>
The farmer, one day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a bagful of gold,<br>
Said, "Pardon me, sir,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I long have desired<br>
To purchase my farm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the land can be sold.<br>
<p>
"Ten years I've been blest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With success and with health,<br>
With trials a few&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank God, not severe&mdash;<br>
I am grateful. I hope,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not proud of my wealth,<br>
But I've managed to lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By a hundred a year."<br>
<p>
"Why how," exclaimed Dick,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Can this possibly be?"<br>
(With a stare of surprise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a mortified laugh,)<br>
"The whole of my farm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Proved too little for me,<br>
And you it appears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have grown rich upon half."<br>
<p>
"I hope you'll excuse me,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The farmer replies,<br>
"But I'll tell you the cause,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If your honor would know;<br>
In two little words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All the difference lies,<br>
I always say Come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you used to say Go."<br>
<p>
"Well, and what does that mean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My good fellow?" he said.<br>
"Why this, sir, that I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Always rise with the sun;<br>
You said 'Go' to your man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As you lay in your bed,<br>
I say 'Come, Jack, with me,'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I see the work done."<br>

<center><b>The Cruel Boy</b></center>
<p>
Tom sat at the kitchen window<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching the folks go by,<br>
But what he was really doing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was pulling the legs from a fly.<br>
<p>
Yes, there he sat in the twilight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tormenting the tiny things;<br>
First pulling their legs from their sockets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And afterwards pulling their wings.<br>
<p>
He knew not that his father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was standing behind his back;<br>
And very much wished to be giving<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His cruel young fingers a crack.<br>
<p>
But he waited till after dinner,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When Tommy was having a game;<br>
Then he thought he would give him a lesson,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And treat him a little the same.<br>
<p>
So catching his son of a sudden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And giving his elbow a twist;<br>
He pulled his two ears till he shouted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then hit him quite hard with his fist.<br>
<p>
And did he not roll on the carpet?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And did he not cry out in pain?<br>
But, when he cried out "Oh, you hurt me!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His father would hit him again.<br>
<p>
"Why, Tom, all this is quite jolly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You don't seem to like it, my boy;<br>
And yet, when you try it on others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You always are singing with joy;<br>
<p>
"It seems very strange," said his father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And this time his nose had a pull;<br>
But Tommy could stand it no longer;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He bellowed and roared like a bull.<br>
<p>
"Hush! hush! while I pull your right leg off,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And scrape off the flesh from your shin;<br>
What you often yourself do to others,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure you do not think harm or a sin.<br>
<p>
"Now, Tommy, my boy," said his father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"You'll leave these poor things alone,<br>
If not, I go on with my lesson."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will," cried poor Tom, with a groan.<br>
<p>
But hark! from the woodlands the sound of a gun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounded bird flutters and dies;<br>
Where can be the pleasure for nothing but fun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To shoot the poor thing as it flies?<br>
<p>
Or you, Mr. Butcher, and Fisherman, you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May follow your trades, I must own:<br>
So chimneys are swept when they want it&mdash;but who<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would sweep them for pleasure alone?<br>
<p>
If men would but think of the torture they give<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To creatures that cannot complain,<br>
They surely would let the poor animals live,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And not make a sport of their pain.<br>

And he was at home<br>

<p>
There stood in the cupboard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So sweet and so nice,<br>

As he stretched out his arm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To reach up to the shelf;<br>
"This apple, at least,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall be mine."<br>
<p>
John paused and put back<br>

His comrades had plotted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The orchard to rob,<br>

If you will go with us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll give you a share,<br>
If not, you shall have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither apple nor pear."<br>
<p>
They spoke, and Tom pondered&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I see they will go;<br>
Poor man! What a pity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To injure him so!<br>
Poor man! I would save him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His fruit if I could,<br>
But staying behind<br>

"If this matter depended<br>

His apples might hang<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till they dropped from the tree;<br>
But since they <i>will</i> take them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I'll go too,<br>
He will lose none by me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I get a few."<br>
<p>
His scruples this silenced,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom felt more at ease,<br>
And went with his comrades<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The apples to seize;<br>
He blamed and protested<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But joined in the plan,<br>
He shared in the plunder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But pitied the man.<br>

Who was his mother's pride and joy,<br>
At school a primer stole one day,<br>
And homeward then did wend his way.<br>
<p>
He told his mother of the theft,<br>
While she, of principle bereft,<br>
Patted him on the head and smil'd.<br>
And said, "You are my own dear child."<br>
<p>
She praised him for the cunning feat,<br>
And gave him a nice apple sweet.<br>
In course of years the boy grew fast,<br>
Till he became a man at last;<br>
<p>
But all the time he slyly stole&mdash;<br>
Sometimes a piece&mdash;sometimes the whole,<br>
Till, finally, he grew so bold,<br>
He kill'd a man and took his gold.<br>
<p>
The day on which he had to swing<br>
Did a large crowd together bring.<br>
Among the rest his mother came,<br>
And called him fondly by his name.<br>
<p>
The sheriff gave him leave to tell<br>
The broken-hearted dame farewell!<br>
About his neck her arms she flung,<br>
And cried, "Why must my child be hung?"<br>
<p>
He answered, "Call me not your dear."<br>
And by one stroke bit off her ear;<br>
While all the crowd cried, "Oh! for shame!<br>
Not satisfied to blast her name.<br>
<p>
You add this violence to one<br>
Whose happiness you have undone!"<br>
"Good people," he replied, "I'll vow<br>
I would not be a felon now.<br>
<p>
If my mother had only tried<br>
To win me to the better side.<br>
But when in infancy I took<br>
What was not mine, a small torn book,<br>
<p>
Instead of punishing the feat<br>
She gave to me an apple sweet;<br>
She prais'd me too, and softly smil'd,<br>
And said, 'You are my own dear child!'<br>
<p>
I tell you here, both foe and friend,<br>
This is the cause of my sad end."<br>

<center><b>The Boys And The Apple Tree</b></center><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As Billy and Tommy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were walking one day,<br>
They came by a fine orchard side;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd rather eat apples<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than spell, read, or play,<br>
And Tommy to Billy then cried,<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"O brother, look! see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What fine clusters hang there,<br>
I'll jump and climb over the wall;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will have an apple,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will have a pear,<br>
Or else it shall cost me a fall."<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Billy to Tommy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To steal is a sin,<br>
Mamma has oft told this to thee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O never yet stole,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor now will begin,<br>
So red apples hang on the tree."<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are a good boy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you ever have been,"<br>
Said Tommy; let's walk on, my lad;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll call on our school-fellow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Bob Green,<br>
And to see us I know he'll be glad."<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to a house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they rang at the gate,<br>
And asked, "Pray, is Bobby at home?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bobby's good manners<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not let them wait;<br>
He out of the parlour did come.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob smil'd, and he laughed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he caper'd with joy,<br>
His little companions to view.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"We call'd in to see you,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said each little boy.<br>
Said Bobby, "I'm glad to see you.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come walk in our garden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So large and so fine;<br>
You shall, for my father gives leave;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And more, he insists<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you'll stay here to dine:<br>
A rare jolly day we shall have!"<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But when in the garden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They found 'twas the same<br>
They saw as they walk'd in the road;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And near the high wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When these little boys came,<br>
They started, as if from a toad.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"That large ring of iron,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which lies on the ground,<br>
With terrible teeth like a saw,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Bobby, "the guard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our garden is found;<br>
It keeps wicked robbers in awe.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The warning without,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they should set an nought,<br>
This trap tears their legs&mdash;O! so sad!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Billy to Tommy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So you'd have been caught,<br>
A narrow escape you have had."<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried Tommy, I'll mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What my good mamma says,<br>
And take the advice of a friend;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I never will steal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the end of my days,<br>
I've been a bad boy, but I'll mend."<br>

<center><b>The Thieves' Ladder</b></center><br>
<p>
The girls were helping in the house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With bustle and with show,<br>
And told the boys to go away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And not disturb them so.<br>
And the boys went whistling down the streets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking in the shops<br>
At tempting heaps of oranges,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And piles of sugar-drops.<br>
<p>
"Here, Willie, to the grocer's run;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sharp, now&mdash;there's a man,<br>
And bring me home a pound of plums<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As quickly as you can!<br>
"Don't touch a plum&mdash;be sure you don't;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To-morrow you shall eat."<br>
"I won't." he said, and, like a top,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went spinning down the street.<br>
<p>
The grocer weigh'd them in his scales,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there was one too much;<br>
He took it out, and all was right,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The scale was to a touch.<br>
He wrapp'd them up in whitey-brown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tied them with a string,<br>
And put the money in the till,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As 'twere a common thing.<br>
<p>
Young Willie watched, with greedy eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As this affair went on.<br>
The plums&mdash;they look'd so very nice!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He wouldn't take but <i>one</i>.<br>
So going quick behind a post,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He tore the paper so<br>
That he could take out two or three,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And nobody would know.<br>
<p>
There was a little voice that said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Close by, in Willie's heart,<br>
"Don't tear the hole&mdash;don't take the plum&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't play a thievish part!"<br>
The little voice&mdash;it spoke in vain!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He reach'd his mother's door;<br>
She did not see the hole he'd made,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His trouble then was o'er.<br>
<p>
And what a trifling thing it seem'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To take one single plum!<br>
A little thing we hold between<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our finger and out thumb.<br>
And yet upon that Christmas eve,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That period so brief,<br>
Young Willie set his foot upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The ladder of the thief!"<br>
<p>
And as he lay awake that night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard his parents speak;<br>
He heard distinctly what they said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood rush'd to his cheek.<br>
He lay and listn'd earnestly;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They might have found him out,<br>
And he might get a flogging too,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas that he thought about.<br>
<p>
A guilty person cannot rest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He always is in fear;<br>
Not knowing what may happen next<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make his guilt appear.<br>
So, when he heard his mother speak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He rose up in his bed,<br>
And did not lose a syllable<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of every word she said:&mdash;<br>
<p>
"We have not any turnips, John,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I could not spare the pence;<br>
But you can go and get us some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Farmer Turner's fence.<br>
"There's nobody to see you now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The folks are off the road;<br>
The night looks dark and blustering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And no one is abroad.<br>
<p>
"It is not far&mdash;you'll soon be back&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll stand outside to hear;<br>
The watchman now is off his track,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And won't be coming near."<br>
The father he went softly out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And down the lane he crept,<br>
And stole some turnips from the field<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst honest people slept!<br>
<p>
'Tis not the words that parents say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is their very deed;<br>
Their children know the difference,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And follow where they lead.<br>
How often, if their lives are good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their children's are the same;<br>
Whilst, if they're thievish, drunken,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their children come to shame!<br>
<p>
Now, Willie laid him down in bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His conscience found relief;<br>
"I'm not the only one," he said&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"My father is a thief!<br>
"How foolish 'twas to be afraid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About a little plum!"<br>
He pull'd the bed-clothes o'er his head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dream'd of feasts to come.<br>
<p>
On Christmas-day they had the pies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The turnips, and the beef;<br>
And Willie's foot was firm upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder of the thief.<br>
And ere the snow was on the plain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Christmas-day came round,<br>
And boys were sliding, once again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the frozen ground,<br>
<p>
He, step by step, had further gone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon that dreadful road<br>
That brings a man to misery,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And takes him far from God.<br>
He cheated with his marbles first,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then at other play;<br>
He pilfered any little thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That came within his way.<br>
<p>
His parents did not punish him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He went from bad to worse,<br>
Until he grew so confident,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He stole a lady's purse.<br>
Then he was seized, and brought before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The city magistrate;<br>
And the police and lady came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The robbery to state.<br>
<p>
And Willie he was proved a thief,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing had to say;<br>
So to the dreadful prison-house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He soon was led away.<br>
In vain he cried, and pleaded hard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They would not take him there;<br>
He would not do such things again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If they would hear his prayer.<br>
<p>
It was too late! The prison door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With bolt, and bar, and chain,<br>
Was opened to take Willie in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then was shut again.<br>
He saw the handcuffs on the wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The fetters on the floor;<br>
And heavy keys with iron rings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To lock the dungeon door.<br>
<p>
He saw the little, lonely cells<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where prisoners were kept,<br>
And all the dreary passages,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bitterly he wept.<br>
And through the strong-barred iron grate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;High up and far away,<br>
He saw a piece of clear blue sky<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out in the blessed day.<br>
<p>
And "Oh!" he said, "my brothers now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are out of school again,<br>
And playing marbles on the path,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or cricket on the plain.<br>
"And here am I, shut up so close<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within this iron door;<br>
If ever I get out again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll give this business o'er."<br>
<p>
And Willie went to sleep that night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his dark cell alone;<br>
But often in his troubled dreams<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned with heavy moan.<br>
What sound is that at early morn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That breaks upon his ear?<br>
A funeral bell is tolling slow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It tolls so very near.<br>
<p>
And in the court he sees a crowd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So haggard and so pale,<br>
And they are whispering fearfully<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sad and awful tale.<br>
And all seem looking at a man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stands with fetters bound,<br>
And guards and executioner<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are gathered close around.<br>
<p>
And he beheld that wretched man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who trembled like a leaf:<br>
His foot no more would stand upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder of the thief.<br>
For he had climbed it step by step,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till murder closed the whole;<br>
The hangman came to take his life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But where would be his soul?<br>
<p>
And still the bell went tolling on;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It tolled so heavily<br>
As that young man went up the stairs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out to the gallows-tree.<br>
It tolled&mdash;it tolled&mdash;Oh! heavy sound!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It stopped&mdash;the deed is o'er;<br>
And that young man upon the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will now be seen no more:<br>
<p>
Oh! parents watch your little ones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest you have such a grief;<br>
Help not their tender feet to climb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ladder of the thief.<br>
I have not heard young Willie's end,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope he learned that day;<br>
But 'tis a thing most difficult<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave a wicked way.<br>
<p>

I have given no Fairy Tales in this Childland. For in this
<i>matter-of-fact</i> age belief in Fairy Tales and all kinds of
wonderful
fictions is fast vanishing. Santa Claus, the "bestest" "goodest"
fairy of all alone remains: and even he is gradually being doubted by
all but the most innocent children, but as he as a personality is
still largely amongst us, I give his popular history culled from many

<center><b>Santa Claus Land</b></center><br>
<p>
At the top of the earth, which they call the North
Pole,<br>
Is where Santa Claus lives, a right jolly old soul!<br>
And the ice and the snow lie so thick on the ground<br>
The sun cannot melt them the whole summer round.<br>
<p>
All wrapped up in furs from his head to his toes,<br>
No feeling of coldness dear Santa Claus knows,<br>
But travels about with a heart full of joy,<br>
As happy as if he were only a boy.<br>
<p>
His cheeks are like roses; his eyes are as bright<br>
As stars that shine out overhead in the night,<br>
And they twinkle as merrily too all the while,<br>
And broad as a sunbeam is Santa Claus' smile.<br>
<p>
He never is idle except when asleep,<br>
And even in dreams at his labours will keep,<br>
And all thro' the day and the night, it is true,<br>
He is working and planning, dear children, for you.<br>
<p>
On top of his tower with spy-glass in hand,<br>
He goes every morning to look o'er the land,<br>
And though there are hills all around, I suppose,<br>
He sees, oh, much further than any one knows.<br>
<p>
He peeps into houses whose doors are tight shut;<br>
He looks through the palace, and likewise the hut;<br>
He gazes on cities, and villages small,<br>
And nothing, no, nothing is hidden at all.<br>
<p>
He knows where the good children live beyond doubt,<br>
He knows where the bad boys and girls are about,<br>
And writes down their names on a page by themselves;<br>
In a book that he keeps on his library shelves.<br>
<p>
For good little children, the gentle and kind,<br>
The prettiest presents of toys are designed,<br>
And when Christmas comes round, as it does once a
year,<br>
'Tis certain that Santa Claus then will appear.<br>
<p>
His work-shop is, oh! such a wonderful place,<br>
With heaps of gay satins, and ribbons, and lace;<br>
With houses and furniture, dishes and pans,<br>
And bracelets and bangles, and all sorts of fans.<br>
<p>
There are horses that gallop, and dollies that walk,<br>
And some of the pretty doll-babies can talk.<br>
There are pop-guns, and marbles, and tops for the
boys,<br>
And big drums and trumpets that make a big noise.<br>
<p>
There are games for all seasons, the base-ball and
kite,<br>
And books which the children will seize with delight,<br>
And the skates and the sleds, far too many to count,<br>
And the bicycles ready for wheelmen to mount.<br>
<p>
There are farm-yards in plenty, with fences and trees,<br>
And cows, sheep, and oxen, all taking their ease,<br>
And turkeys and ducks, and fine chickens and hens,<br>
And dear little piggies to put in their pens.<br>
<p>
There are gay Noah's Arks, just as full as can be<br>
Of animals, really a wonder to see;<br>
There are lions and tigers, and camels and bears,<br>
And two of each kind, for they travel in pairs.<br>
<p>
There are elephants stretching their noses quite long;<br>
And reindeer and elks with their antlers so strong,<br>
And queer kangaroos all the others amid,<br>
With their dear little babies in pockets well hid.<br>
<p>
Is Santa Claus happy? There's no need to ask,<br>
For he finds such enjoyment indeed in his task,<br>
That he bubbles with laughter, and whistles and sings,<br>
While making and planning the beautiful things.<br>
<p>
He's a jolly good fellow, but ever so shy,<br>
And likes to do all his good deeds on the sly,<br>
So there's no use spoiling a good winter's nap<br>
For you'll not catch a glimpse of the jolly old chap.<br>
<p>
When Christmas Eve comes, into bed you must creep,<br>
And late in the night when you are asleep,<br>
He is certain to come; so your stockings prepare,<br>
And hang them up close by the chimney with care.<br>
<p>
The baby's wee stockings you must not forget,<br>
For Santa will have something nice for the pet,<br>
And those who are thoughtful for others will find<br>
The good saint at Christmas time has them in mind.<br>
<p>
There is Tommy, who tended the baby with care,<br>
A nice train of cars he shall have for his share,<br>
And how happy will Eliza be when she looks<br>
For her presents, and finds such a budget of books.<br>
<p>
For dear little Mary, a doll there will be;<br>
And for Alice and Jenny a gay Christmas tree;<br>
And wee little Georgie, the baby, will find<br>
A big stick of candy, just suiting his mind.<br>
<p>
Oh, a jolly good sight is this funny old chap<br>
When he's dressed in his bear-skin and fur-bordered
cap,<br>
All ready to start on his way through the cold,<br>
In a sleigh covered over with jewels and gold.<br>
<p>
While his deer from the mountains all harnessed with
care,<br>
Like race-horses prance through the clear frosty air;<br>
'Tis fun just to watch them, and hear the bells ring,<br>
And the stars seem to think it a comical thing.<br>
<p>
For old Santa is bundled so close to the chin,<br>
That there is not a chance for the cold to get in,<br>
His cheeks are so rosy, his eyes how they flash!<br>
No horses nor driver e'er cut such a dash!<br>
<p>
He cracks his long whip, and he whistles a tune,<br>
While he winks at the stars, and he bows to the moon,<br>
And over the tree-tops he drives like the wind,<br>
And leaves all the night-birds a long way behind.<br>
<p>
His steeds speed away on a journey so fleet,<br>
That they seem to have wings to their swift-flying
feet,<br>
For there's work to be done by a cheery old man,<br>
And his coursers will help him as well as they can.<br>
<p>
His sleigh is with toys and trinkets well packed,<br>
You never beheld one with pleasures so stacked;<br>
And though of good children he has such a list,<br>
Not one is forgotten, not one will be missed.<br>
<p>
An army he gives to the boy who is neat,<br>
And never is rude in the house or the street;<br>
And a farm to the lad who goes smiling to school,<br>
Who knows all his lessons and minds every rule.<br>
<p>
And if you would please him&mdash;dear Bertie and
Jack&mdash;;<br>
And win a nice prize from the old fellow's pack,<br>
Be good little children, your parents obey,<br>
And strive to be happy at work or at play.<br>
<p>
At Christmas old Santa Claus toils like a Turk,<br>
For the cheery old fellow is fond of his work.<br>
With his queer looking team through the air he will
go,<br>
And alight on the house-tops all covered in snow.<br>
<p>
Then down through the chimneys he'll dart without
noise<br>
And fill up the stockings with candy and toys.<br>
There'll be presents for Julia, and Nellie, and Jack,<br>
And plenty more left in the old fellow's pack.<br>
<p>
And if Frank behaves well, and minds what is said,<br>
Quits teasing the cat and goes early to bed;<br>
He'll find for his present a sled or a gun,<br>
A ready companion in frolic and fun.<br>
<p>
On Santa Claus hurries, and works with a will,<br>
For many tall Christmas trees he has to fill,<br>
And loads them with treasures from out his rich store,<br>
Till they blossom as trees never blossomed before.<br>
<p>
Though round as a dumpling, and ever so fat,<br>
In running and climbing he's spry as a cat,<br>
And if the long ladder should happen to break,<br>
And he should fall down, what a crash it would make!<br>
<p>
I told you his home was up North by the Pole,<br>
In a palace of hives lives this worthy old soul,<br>
And though out of doors it may furiously storm,<br>
Indoors as we know, it is sunny and warm.<br>
<p>
When Christmas is over old Santa Claus goes<br>
To his home in the North, and his well-earned repose,<br>
And when he is rested and feeling tip-top,<br>
The good-natured workman goes back to his shop.<br>
<p>
And there he will labor from morning till night,<br>
To make others happy his aim and delight,<br>
And if his good-will the dear children would earn,<br>
They must strive to be happy and good in return.<br>
<p>
He comes like an angel of light from above,<br>
To do on the earth sweetest errands of love;<br>
And our hearts and our homes to so fill with good
cheer<br>
That we cannot help knowing when Christmas is near.<br>
<p>
Then let us be glad, so that Christmas may be<br>
A real Merry Christmas to you and to me!<br>
And now that the story is ended we'll give<br>
Three cheers for old Santa Claus! Long may he live!<br>

<center><b>A Visit From St. Nicholas</b></center><br>
<p>
'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the
house<br>
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br>
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br>
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.<br>
<p>
The children were nestled all snug in there beds,<br>
While visions of sugar-plums danced through their
heads;<br>
And mamma in her kerchief and I in my cap<br>
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,<br>
When out in the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br>
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.<br>
<p>
Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br>
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash;<br>
The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow,<br>
Gave a lustre of midday to objects below;<br>
<p>
When what to my wondering eyes should appear<br>
But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,<br>
With a little old driver so lively and quick<br>
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br>
<p>
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,<br>
And he whistled and shouted and called them by name;<br>
"Now Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and Vixen!<br>
On Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!<br>
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall,<br>
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!"<br>
<p>
As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,<br>
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,<br>
So up to the housetop the coursers they flew,<br>
With a sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too;<br>
And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof<br>
The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br>
<p>
As I drew in my head and was turning around,<br>
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound,<br>
He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,<br>
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and
soot;<br>
A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,<br>
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack,<br>
His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!<br>
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.<br>
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br>
And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.<br>
<p>
He was chubby and plump&mdash;a right jolly old
elf&mdash;<br>
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;<br>
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head<br>
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.<br>
<p>
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br>
And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk,<br>
And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br>
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.<br>
<p>
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br>
And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;<br>
But I heard him exclaim ere he drove out sight;<br>
"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night."<br>

<center><b>A Christmas Eve Adventure</b></center><br>
<p>
Once on a time, in a queer little town,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shore of the Zuyder Zee,<br>
When all the good people were fast asleep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A strange thing happened to me.<br>
<p>
Alone, the night before Christmas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I sat by the glowing fire,<br>
Watching the flame as it rose and fell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While the sparks shot high and higher.<br>
<p>
Suddenly one of these sparks began<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To flicker and glimmer and wink<br>
Like a big bright eye, till I hardly knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do or to say or to think.<br>
<p>
Quick as a flash, it changed to a face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And what in the world did I see<br>
But dear old Santa Claus nodding his head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And waving his hand to me!<br>
<p>
"Oh! follow me, follow me!" soft he cried,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And up through the chimney with him<br>
I mounted, not daring to utter a word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till we stood on the chimney's rim.<br>
<p>
"Now tell me, I beg you, dear Santa Claus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where am I going with you?"<br>
He laughingly answered, "Why, don't you know?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To travel the whole world through!<br>
<p>
"From my crystal palace, far in the North,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have come since dark,&mdash;and see<br>
These curious things for the little folk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who live on the Zuyder Zee."<br>
<p>
Then seating himself in his reindeer sledge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And drawing me down by his side,<br>
He whistled, and off on the wings of the wind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We flew for our midnight ride.<br>
<p>
But first, such comical presents he left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the little Dutch girls and
boys,&mdash;<br>
Onions and sausages, wooden-faced dolls,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheeses and gingerbread toys!<br>
<p>
Away we hurried far to the South,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the beautiful land of France;<br>
And there we showered the loveliest gifts,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flaxen-haired dolls that could dance.<br>
<p>
Soldiers that marched at the word of command,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Necklaces, bracelets and rings,<br>
Tiny gold watches, all studded with gems,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hundreds of exquisite things.<br>
<p>
Crossing the Channel, we made a short call<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Scotland and Ireland, too;<br>
Left a warm greeting for England and Wales,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then over the ocean we flew<br>
<p>
Straight to America, where by myself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perched on a chimney high,<br>
I watched him scramble and bustle about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Between the earth and the sky.<br>
<p>
Many a stocking he filled to the brim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And numberless Christmas trees<br>
Burst into bloom at his magical touch!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then all of a sudden a breeze<br>
<p>
Caught us and bore us away to the South,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And afterwards blew us "out West;"<br>
And never till dawn peeped over the hills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did we stop for a moment's rest.<br>
<p>
"Christmas is coming!" he whispered to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"You can see his smile in the sky,&mdash;<br>
I wish Merry Christmas to all the world!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My work is over,&mdash;good-bye!"<br>
<p>
Like a flash he was gone, and I was alone,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all of this happened to me<br>
Once on a time, in a queer little town<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the shore of the Zuyder Zee!<br>

<center><b>Little Bennie</b></center><br>
<p>
I had told him, Christmas morning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he sat upon my knee,<br>
Holding fast his little stockings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stuffed as full as can be,<br>
And attentive listening to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a face demure and mild,<br>
That old Santa Claus, who filled them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not love a naughty child.<br>
<p>
"But we'll be good, won't we, moder?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And from off my lap he slid,<br>
Digging deep among the goodies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his crimson stockings hid.<br>
While I turned me to my table,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a tempting goblet stood,<br>
Brimming high with a dainty custard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sent me by a neighbour good.<br>
<p>
But the kitten, there before me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his white paw, nothing loth,<br>
Sat, by way of entertainment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lapping off the shining froth;<br>
And, in not the gentlest humour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the loss of such a treat,<br>
I confess I rather rudely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrust him out into the street.<br>
<p>
Then how Bennie's blue eyes kindled;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathering up the precious store<br>
He had busily been pouring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his tiny pinafore,<br>
With a generous look that shamed me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sprang he from the carpet bright,<br>
Showing, by his mien indignant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All a baby's sense of right.<br>
<p>
"Come back Harney," called he loudly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he held his apron white,<br>
"You shall have my candy wabbit;"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the door was fastened tight.<br>
So he stood, abashed and silent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the centre of the floor,<br>
With defeated look, alternate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent on me and on the door.<br>
<p>
Then, as by some sudden impulse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly ran he to the fire,<br>
And while eagerly his bright eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Watched the flames grow high and higher,<br>
In a brave, clear key he shouted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some lordly little elf,<br>
"Santa Kaus, come down the chimney,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make my mother 'have herself."<br>
<p>
"I'll be a good girl, Bennie,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said I, feeling the reproof;<br>
And straightway recalled poor Harney,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mewing on the galley roof.<br>
Soon the anger was forgotten,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Laughter chased away the frown,<br>
And they gambolled 'neath the live oaks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the dusky night came down.<br>
<p>
In my dim, fire-lighted chamber<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Harney purred beneath my chair,<br>
And my play-worn boy beside me<br>
&nbsp;Knelt to say his evening prayer:<br>
"God bess fader, God bess moder,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;God bess sister," then a pause,<br>
And the sweet young lips devoutly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Murmured "God bess Santa Kaus."<br>
<p>
He is sleeping: brown and silken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie the lashes, long and meek,<br>
Like caressing, clinging shadows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On his plump and peachy cheek;<br>
And I bend above him, weeping,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankful tears; O undefiled;<br>
For a woman's crown of glory,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the blessing of a child.<br>

<p>
Old Santa Claus sat alone in his den,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his leg crossed over his knee;<br>
While a comical look peeped out at his eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For a funny old fellow was he.<br>
<p>
His queer little cap was tumbled and torn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his wig it was all awry;<br>
But he sat and mused the whole day long,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While the hours went flying by.<br>
<p>
He had been busy as busy can be,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In filling his pack with toys;<br>
He had gathered his nuts and baked his pies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To give to the girls and boys.<br>
<p>
There were dolls for the girls, and whips for the
boys,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With wheelbarrows, horses and drays,<br>
And bureaus and trunks for Dolly's new clothes;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All these in his pack he displays.<br>
<p>
Of candy too, both twisted and striped,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He had furnished a plentiful store,<br>
While raisins and figs, and prunes and grapes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hung up on a peg by the door.<br>
<p>
"I am almost ready," quoth he, quoth he,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And Christmas is almost here;<br>
But one thing more&mdash;I must write a book,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And give to each one this year."<br>
<p>
So he clapped his specs on his little round nose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seizing the stump of a pen,<br>
He wrote more lines in one little hour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than you ever could write in ten.<br>
<p>
He told them stories all pretty and new,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrote them all out in rhyme;<br>
Then packed them away with his box of toys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To distribute one at a time.<br>
<p>
And Christmas Eve, when all were in bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Right down the chimney he flew;<br>
And stretching the stocking-leg out at the top,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He clapped in a book for you.<br>

<p>
One Christmas Eve, when Santa Claus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Came to a certain house,<br>
To fill the children's stockings there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He found a little mouse.<br>
<p>
"A merry Christmas, little friend,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Santa, good and kind.<br>
"The same to you, sir!" said the mouse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you wouldn't mind<br>
<p>
If I should stay awake to night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch you for a while."<br>
"You're very welcome, little mouse,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Santa, with a smile.<br>
<p>
And then he filled the stockings up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the mouse could wink,&mdash;<br>
From toe to top, from top to toe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There wasn't left a chink.<br>
<p>
"Now, they won't hold another thing,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Santa Claus with pride.<br>
A twinkle came in mousie's eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But humbly he replied:<br>
<p>
"It's not nice to contradict&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your pardon I implore,&mdash;<br>
But in the fullest stocking there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I could put one thing more."<br>
<p>
"Oh, ho!" laughed Santa, "silly mouse!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't I know how to pack?<br>
By filling stockings all these years,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have learned the knack."<br>
<p>
And then he took the stocking down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From where it hung so high,<br>
And said: "Now put in one thing more;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I give you leave to try."<br>
<p>
The mousie chuckled to himself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he softly stole<br>
Right to the stocking's crowded toe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gnawed a little hole!<br>
<p>
"Now, if you please, good Santa Claus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I've put in one thing more;<br>
For you will own, that little hole<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not in there before."<br>
<p>
How Santa Claus did laugh and laugh;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he gaily spoke;<br>
"Well, you shall have a Christmas cheese,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For that nice little joke."<br>

<center><b>Annie And Willie's Prayer</b></center><br>
<p>
'Twas the eve before Christmas; good night had been
said,<br>
And Annie and Willie had crept into bed.<br>
There were tears on their pillows, and tears in their
eyes,<br>
And each little bosom was heaving with sighs;<br>
<p>
For to-night their stern father's command had been
given,<br>
That they should retire precisely at seven<br>
Instead of at eight; for they had troubled him more<br>
With questions unheard of than ever before.<br>
<p>
He had told them he thought this delusion a sin;<br>
No such creature as "Santa Claus" ever had been;<br>
And he hoped, after this, he should never more hear<br>
How he scrambled down chimneys with presents each
year.<br>
<p>
And this was the reason that two little heads<br>
So restlessly tosses on their soft, downy beds.<br>
Eight, nine, and the clock on the steeple tolled ten;<br>
Not a word had been spoken by either till then;<br>
<p>
When Willie's sad face from the blanket did peep,<br>
And he whispered: "Dear Annie, is 'ou fast asleep?"<br>
"Why, no, Brother Willie," a sweet voice replies;<br>
"I've long tried in vain, but I can't shut my eyes;<br>
<p>
"For somehow it makes me so sorry because<br>
Dear Papa has said there is no Santa Claus.<br>
Now we know there is, and it can't be denied<br>
For he came every year before dear mamma died;<br>
<p>
"But then, I've been thinking, that she used to
pray,&mdash;<br>
And God would hear everything dear mamma would
say,&mdash;<br>
And, maybe, she asked him to send Santa Claus here<br>
With the sack full of presents he brought every year."<br>
<p>
"Well, why tannot we p'ay, dust as mamma did, den,<br>
And ask Dod to send him with presents aden?"<br>
"I've been thinking so, too;" and without a word more<br>
Four little bare feet bounded out on the floor,<br>
<p>
And four little knees on the soft carpet pressed,<br>
And two tiny hands were clasped close to each breast,<br>
"Now, Willie, you know, we must firmly believe<br>
That the presents we ask for we're sure to receive;<br>
<p>
"You must wait just as still till I say the 'Amen,'<br>
And by that you will know that your turn has come
then.&mdash;<br>
"Dear Jesus, look down on my brother and me,<br>
And grant us the favours we're asking of Thee.<br>
<p>
"I want a wax dolly, a tea-set and a ring,<br>
And an ebony work-box that shuts with a spring.<br>
Bless papa, dear Jesus, and cause him to see<br>
That Santa Claus loves us as much as does he.<br>
<p>
"Don't let hem get fretful and angry again,<br>
At dear brother Willie and Annie. Amen."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dear Desus, 'et Santa Taus tum down to
night<br>
And bring us some p'esents before it is 'ight;<br>
<p>
"I want he sood div' me a nice little sled,<br>
Wid bight shinin' 'unners, and all painted 'ed<br>
A box full of tandy, a book, and a toy,<br>
Amen. And den, Desus, I'll be a dood boy."<br>
<p>
Their prayers being ended, they raised up their heads,<br>
And with hearts light and cheerful again sought their
beds;<br>
They were soon lost in slumber both peaceful and deep,<br>
And with fairies in dreamland were roaming in sleep.<br>
<p>
Eight, nine, and the little French clock had struck
ten<br>
Ere the father had thought of his children again;<br>
He seems now to hear Annie's self-suppressed sighs,<br>
And to see the big tears stand in Willie's blue eyes.<br>
<p>
"I was harsh with my darlings," he mentally said,<br>
"And should not have sent them so early to bed:<br>
But then I was troubled: My feelings found vent;<br>
For the bank-stock to-day has gone down two percent.;<br>
<p>
"But of course they've forgotten their troubles ere
this,<br>
And that I denied them the thrice-asked-for kiss;<br>
But just to make sure I'll steal up to their
door&mdash;<br>
To my darlings I have never spoke harshly before."<br>
<p>
So saying, he softly ascended the stairs,<br>
And arrived at the door to hear both of their prayers;<br>
His Annie's "Bless papa" drew forth the big tears,<br>
And Willie's grave promise fell sweet on his ears.<br>
<p>
"Strange, strange! I'd forgotten," he said with a
sigh,<br>
"How I longed when a child to have Christmas draw nigh<br>
I'll atone for my harshness," he inwardly said,<br>
"By answering their prayers ere I sleep in my bed."<br>
<p>
Then he turned to the stairs, and softly went down,<br>
Threw off velvet slippers and silk dressing gown.<br>
Donned hat, coat and boots, and was out in the street,<br>
A millionaire facing the cold, driving sleet!<br>
<p>
Nor stopped he until he had bought everything,<br>
From the box full of candy to the tiny gold ring:<br>
Indeed, he kept adding so much to his store,<br>
That the various presents outnumbered a score.<br>
<p>
Then homeward he turned, when his holiday load,<br>
With Aunt Mary's help, in the nursery was stow'd.<br>
Miss Dolly was seated beneath a pine tree,<br>
And the side of a table spread out for her tea;<br>
<p>
A work-box, well-filled, in the centre was laid,<br>
And on it the ring for which Annie had pray'd.<br>
A soldier in uniform stood by a sled,<br>
With bright shining runners, and all painted red.<br>
<p>
There were balls, dogs, horses; books pleasing to see;<br>
And birds of all colours were perched in the tree;<br>
While Santa Claus, laughing, stood up in the top,<br>
As if getting ready more presents to drop.<br>
<p>
Now, as the fond father the picture surveyed,<br>
He thought for his trouble he'd amply been paid;<br>
As he said to himself, as he brushed off a tear,<br>
"I'm happier to night than I have been for a year;<br>
<p>
"I've enjoyed more true pleasure than ever before;<br>
What care I if bank-stock fell two per cent. more!<br>
Henceforward I'll make it a rule, I believe,<br>
To have Santa Clause visit us each Christmas-eve."<br>
<p>
So thinking, he gently extinguished the light,<br>
And, slipping downstairs, retired for the night.<br>
As soon as the beams of the bright morning sun<br>
Put the darkness to flight, and the stars one by one,<br>
<p>
Four little blue eyes out of sleep opened wide,<br>
And at the same moment the presents espied.<br>
Then out of their beds they sprang with a bound,<br>
And the very gifts prayed for were all of them found.<br>
<p>
And they laughed and they cried in their innocent
glee,<br>
And shouted for papa to come quick and see<br>
What presents old Santa Claus brought in the night<br>
(Just the things they wanted!), and left before light.<br>
<p>
"And now," added Annie, in a voice soft and low,<br>
"You'll believe there's a Santa Claus, papa, I know;"<br>
While dear little Willie climbed up on his knee,<br>
Determined no secret between them should be;<br>
<p>
And told, in soft whispers, how Annie had said<br>
That their blessed mamma, so long ago dead,<br>
Used to kneel down and pray by the side of her chair,<br>
And that God up in heaven had answered her prayer.<br>
<p>
"Den we dot up and p'ayed just as well as we tood,<br>
And Dod answered our p'ayer, now wasn't He dood?"<br>
"I should say that He was, if He sent you all these,<br>
And knew just what presents my children would please."<br>
<p>
("Well, well, let them think so, dear little elf!<br>
'Twould be cruel to tell him I did it myself.")<br>
<p>
Blind father! who caused your stern heart to relent,<br>
And the hasty words spoken so soon to repent?<br>
'Twas the Being who bade you steal softly upstairs<br>
And made you His agent to answer their prayers.<br>

<center><b>Budds' Christmas Stocking</b></center><br>
<p>
It was Christmas-time, as all the world knew;<br>
It stormed without, and the cold wind blew,<br>
But within all was cheerful, snug, and bright,<br>
With glowing fires and many a light.<br>
<p>
Budd B. was sent quite early to bed,<br>
His stocking was hung up close to his head,<br>
And he said to himself "When all grows still<br>
I will find a big stocking for Santy to fill."<br>
<p>
Now, good, honest Hans, who worked at the house,<br>
Had gone to his bed as still as a mouse;<br>
The room where he slept was one story higher<br>
Than Budd's little room, with gaslight and fire.<br>
<p>
Now, Hans loved "the poy," and petted him too,<br>
And often at night, when his task was all through,<br>
He would tell him strange stories of over the sea,<br>
While Budd listened gravely or laughed out in glee.<br>
<p>
This night Hans had promised to wake Budd at four;<br>
He would softly come down and open his door;<br>
But suddenly Budd bounded out of his bed,<br>
And stole softly up to the room overhead.<br>
<p>
On his hands and his knees he crept softly in,<br>
"I'll borrow Han's stocking," he said, with a grin;<br>
Old Santy will fill it up to the top,<br>
And Hans&mdash;oh, such fun! will be mad as a hop."<br>
<p>
He moved very slowly, and felt near the bed;<br>
No stocking was there, but down on his head<br>
Came a deluge of water, well sprinkled with ice,<br>
While honest Hans held him as if in a vice.<br>
<p>
"Vat is dat?" he cried out; "von robber I find,<br>
Den I pound him, and shake him, so much as I mind"<br>
"It's me," called out Budd; "Stop, Hans! oh, please
do;<br>
I'm only a boy; I could not rob you."<br>
<p>
But Hans did not pause&mdash;his temper was hot&mdash;<br>
And he dragged the young robber at once from the spot,<br>
When he reached the hall light great was his surprise<br>
To find his young master with tears in his eyes.<br>
<p>
"I wanted your stocking," muttered Budd B.;<br>
It is bigger than mine; boo hoo! I can't see,<br>
And I'm all wet and cold." thus cried Budd aloud,<br>
Until guests and his parents ran up in a crowd.<br>
<p>
He was wrapped up with care and taken to bed,<br>
But, strangest of all, not a harsh word was said.<br>
He flattered himself as he fell asleep<br>
That Hans and his friends the secret would keep.<br>
<p>
Next morning, when Christmas songs filled all the air,<br>
Budd found, to his grief and boyish despair,<br>
That his neck was so stiff that he could not turn his
head,<br>
And must spend the whole day alone in his bed.<br>
<p>
What was worse, his own stocking hung limp on a chair,<br>
And on it these words were written most fair:<br>
"To him who is greedy I leave less than all;<br>
The world is so large and my reindeer so small.<br>
<p>
"My pack is elastic when children are kind,<br>
But it shuts with a snap and leaves nothing behind,<br>
When a boy or girl is selfish or mean.<br>
Good-bye, little Budd, I am off with my team.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Signed)  Santa Claus."<br>

<p>
Again the Christmas holidays have come,<br>
We soon will hear the trumpet and the drum;<br>
We'll hear the merry shout of the girls and boys<br>
Rejoicing o'er their gifts of books and toys.<br>
<p>
Old Santa Claus comes by at dead of night,<br>
And down the chimney creeps&mdash;a funny sight;<br>
He fills the stockings full of books and toys,<br>
But puts in whips for naughty girls and boys.<br>
<p>
One Christmas-eve the moon shone clear and bright;<br>
I thought I'd keep awake and watch all night,<br>
But it was silent all around and stilled,<br>
Yet in the morn I found my stockings filled.<br>

<center><b>Christmas Morning</b></center><br>
<p>
They put me in a square bed, and there they bade me
sleep;<br>
I must not stir; I must not wake; I must not even
peep;<br>
Right opposite that lonely bed, my Christmas stocking
hung;<br>
While near it, waiting for the morn, my Sunday clothes
were flung.<br>
<p>
I counted softly, to myself, to ten and ten times ten,<br>
And went through all the alphabet, and then began
again;<br>
I repeated that Fifth-Reader piece&mdash;a poem called
"Repose,"<br>
And tried a dozen various ways to fall into a
dose&mdash;<br>
<p>
When suddenly the room grew light. I heard a soft, strong
bound,<br>
'Twas Santa Claus, I felt quite sure, but dared not look
around.<br>
'Twas nice to know that he was there, and things were
going rightly,<br>
And so I took a little nap, and tried to smile
politely.<br>
<p>
"Ho! Merry Christmas!" cried a voice; I felt the bed
a-rocking;<br>
Twas daylight&mdash;brother Bob was up! and oh, that
splendid stocking!<br>

<center><b>Little Nellie's Visit From Santa Claus</b></center><br>
<p>
Santa Claus is coming to-night, papa;<br>
Please let me sit up and see him, mamma;<br>
Loaded with presents, I'm sure he'll be.<br>
He'll have something nice for you and for me.<br>
<p>
"Mamma, do find something fresh and quite new,<br>
For dear old Santa Claus, when he comes through,<br>
I'll give it myself; I'll keep wide awake;<br>
I know he'll be glad my present to take.<br>
<p>
"Now all go to bed as quick as you please,<br>
I'll wait for him," said the bright little tease,<br>
"He surely will ring, no doubt about that,<br>
I'll bid him come in and then have a chat."<br>
<p>
Soon came a quick step on the piazza floor,<br>
Just then a loud ring was heard at the door.<br>
The little miss rose with dignified air,<br>
Quick ushered him in, and set him a chair.<br>
<p>
All covered o'er with little bells tinkling,<br>
Shaking and laughing, twisting and wriggling,<br>
A funny old man, with little eyes blinking,<br>
Looking at Nellie, what was he thinking?<br>
<p>
Not a word did he say&mdash;tired of waiting,<br>
Nellie arose, her little heart quaking,<br>
Held out her present, courage most failing,<br>
"Santa Claus, take this"&mdash;now she is smiling.<br>
<p>
"His furry old hand, twisting and trembling,<br>
Took the sweet gift&mdash;"You dear little darling,"<br>
Uttered quite softly, tenderly kissing,<br>
The bright little face, ne'er a bit shrinking.<br>
<p>
Lots of presents quickly bestowing,<br>
Thanking her kindly&mdash;he must be going,<br>
Shaking and laughing, his little bells jingling,<br>
Down the steps, hastening off in a twinkling.<br>
<p>
Brave little lady! all are now saying,<br>
Santa Claus truly! bright eyes are asking;<br>
See her dear papa, secretly laughing<br>
At her true faith in Santa Claus' coming.<br>
<p>
Yes! she believes it, ever so truly,<br>
Dear precious darling! rob her not surely,<br>
Of childhood's sweet faith, now in its glory,<br>
While she's relating her own simple story.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis Christmas day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And little May<br>
Peeps from her bed in the morning grey.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looks around,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not a sound<br>
Breaks on the quietness profound.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, heaving sighs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shuts her eyes,<br>
And hard to go to sleep she tries.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sleep has fled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That little bed.<br>
And weary moves the curly head,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until the light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Oh, welcome sight!)<br>
Has banished every trace of night.<br>
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But bonnie May<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will not have nay;<br>
She whispers, "It is Christmas day!"<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, magic sound!<br>

Before, behind, in front and rear.<br>

Would vanish then from girls and boys.<br>

The children shout with laughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The uproar louder grows;<br>
Even grandma chuckles faintly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Johnny chirps and crows.<br>
There ne'er was gilded painting,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;As this rabbit on the wall.<br>
<p>
The cottage work is over,<br>

Hark! thro' the starlight stillness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You hear the river run.<br>
The little children whisper,<br>

"Come, father, make for Johnny,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rabbit on the wall."<br>
<p>
He&mdash;smilingly assenting,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They gather round his chair;<br>
"Now, grandma, you hold Johnny;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't let the candle flare."<br>
So speaking, from his fingers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He throws a shadow tall,<br>
That seems, a moment after,<br>

<p>
The old school-house is still to day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rooms have no gay throng;<br>
No ringing laugh is on the air,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no snatch of song.<br>
The white-haired master sits upon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The seat beneath the tree,<br>
And thinks upon the vanished face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With all its boyish glee.<br>
<p>
But a few short days ago, the lad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was gayest of the gay,<br>
Quick at the page of knowledge, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The heartiest in play.<br>
The pride of the home beside the stream,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his pigeons in their cots,<br>
And finding life a very dream,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In pleasant homely spots.<br>
<p>
His school companions loving him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And old folks speaking praise,<br>
Of the well-loved boy, with frankest eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And cheery, happy ways.<br>
All in the village knew the boy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From parson down to clerk,<br>
And his whistle in the village street<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was clear as the song of lark.<br>
<p>
But like a dream he's passed away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the chamber dim,<br>
In the fair light of summer day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The peasants carry him.<br>
And playmates gather at the grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The old schoolmaster there,<br>
While blossomed boughs wave over-head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all around is fair.<br>
<p>
True is the grief that brings the tear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no empty show;<br>
The simple neighbours see their loss,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is heart-felt woe.<br>
They talk of the bright and lively lad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut down in boyish prime,<br>
And old folks think how strange is life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More strange with passing time!<br>
<p>
Oh! simple sight on green hill-side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Away from pomp and power;<br>
Here are the truths so oft denied<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the imperial hour.<br>
Dear child, how precious are the tears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Suffusing friendly eyes!<br>
Sublimity is in their gleam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A light from God's own skies.<br>

Soon he forgot them,<br>

Never once thought of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The ear and the nose.<br>
<p>
Ah! What a frolic!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All in a glow,<br>
Johnny grew warmer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out in the snow.<br>

Often his breathing<br>

<p>
My brother Jack was nine in May,<br>
And I was eight on New Year's day;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So in Kate Wilson's shop<br>
Papa (he's my papa and Jack's)<br>
Bought me, last week, a doll of wax,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And brother Jack a top.<br>
<p>
Jack's in the pouts, and this it is,<br>
He thinks mine came to more than his;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So to my drawer he goes,<br>
Takes out the doll, and, O, my stars!<br>
He pokes her head between the bars,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And melts off half her nose!<br>
<p>
Quite cross, a bit of string I beg,<br>
And tie it to his peg-top's peg,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bang with might and main,<br>
It's head against the parlor door:<br>
Off flies the head, and hits the floor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And breaks a window-pane.<br>
<p>
This made him cry with rage and spite:<br>
Well, let him cry, it serves him right.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A pretty thing, forsooth!<br>
If he's to melt, all scalding hot.<br>
Half my doll's nose, and I am not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To draw his peg-top's tooth!<br>
<p>
Aunt Hannah heard the window break,<br>
And cried "O naughty Nancy Lake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus to distress your aunt:<br>
No Drury-lane for you to-day!"<br>
And while papa said "Pooh, she may!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mamma said "No she sha'n't!"<br>
<p>
Well, after many a sad reproach,<br>
They got into a hackney coach,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And trotted down the street.<br>
I saw them go: one horse was blind,<br>
The tails of both hung down behind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shoes were on their feet.<br>
<p>
The chaise in which poor brother Bill<br>
Used to be drawn to Pentonville,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood in the lumber-room:<br>
I wiped the dust from off the top,<br>
While molly mopp'd it with a mop,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And brush'd it with a broom.<br>
<p>
My uncle's porter, Samuel Hughes,<br>
Came in at six to black the shoes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I always talk to Sam:)<br>
So what does he, but takes, and drags<br>
Me in the chaise among the flags,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaves me where I am.<br>
<p>
My father's walls are made of brick,<br>
But not so tall and not so thick<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As these; and, goodness me!<br>
My father's beams are made of wood,<br>
But never, never half so good<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As those that now I see.<br>
<p>
What a large floor! 'tis like a town!<br>
The carpet, when they lay it down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Won't hide it, I'll be bound;<br>
And there's a row of lamps!&mdash;my eye!<br>
How they do blaze! I wonder why<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They keep them on the ground.<br>

<center><b>Little Flo's Letter</b></center><br>
<p>
A sweet little baby brother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had come to live with Flo,<br>
And she wanted it brought to the table,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That it might eat and grow.<br>
"It must wait a while," said grandma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer to her plea,<br>
"For a little thing that hasn't teeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't eat like you and me."<br>
<p>
"Why hasn't it got teeth, grandma?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked Flo in great surprise,<br>
"O my, but isn't it funny?&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No teeth, but nose and eyes.<br>
"I guess," after thinking gravely,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They must have been forgot.<br>
Can't we buy him some like grandpa's?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to know why not."<br>
<p>
That afternoon, to the corner,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With paper, and pen, and ink,<br>
Went Flo, saying, "Don't talk to me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do, it'll 'sturb my think.<br>
I'm writing a letter, grandma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To send away to-night,<br>
An' 'cause it's very 'portant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to get it right."<br>
<p>
At last the letter was finished,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A wonderful thing to see,<br>
And directed to "God, in Heaven."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Please read it over to me,"<br>
Said little Flo to her grandma,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"To see if it's right, you know."<br>
And here is the letter written<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To God by little Flo:&mdash;<br>
<p>
"Dear God: The baby you brought us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is awful nice and sweet,<br>
But 'cause you forgot his tooffies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor little thing can't eat.<br>
That's why I'm writing this letter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A purpose to let you know.<br>
Please come and finish the baby,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That's all&mdash;From Little Flo."<br>

<center><b>Papa's Letter</b></center><br>
<p>
I was sitting in my study,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing letters, when I heard:<br>
"Please, dear mamma, Mary told me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That you mustn't be disturbed.<br>
<p>
But I'se tired of the kitty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Want some ozzer thing to do.<br>
Writing letters is 'ou mamma?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tan't I write a letter, too?"<br>
<p>
"Not now, darling, mamma's busy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Run and play with kitty now."<br>
"No&mdash;no mamma; me wite letter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten you will show me how."<br>
<p>
I would paint my darling's portrait,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As his sweet eyes searched my face&mdash;<br>
Hair of gold and eyes of azure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Form of childish witching grace.<br>
<p>
But the eager face was clouded,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As I slowly shook my head,<br>
Till I said: "I'll make a letter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of you, darling boy, instead."<br>
<p>
So I parted back the tresses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From his forehead high and white,<br>
And a stamp in sport I pasted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mid its waves of golden light.<br>
<p>
Then I said: "Now, little letter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Go away and bear good news,"<br>
And I smiled as down the staircase<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clattered loud the little shoes.<br>
<p>
Leaving me, the darling hurried<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Down to Mary in his glee:<br>
"Mamma's witting lots of letters;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'se a letter, Mary, see."<br>
<p>
No one heard the little prattler,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As once more he climbed the stair.<br>
Reached his little cap and tippet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing on the table there.<br>
<p>
No one heard the front door open,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No one saw the golden hair,<br>
As it floated o'er his shoulders<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the crisp October air.<br>
<p>
Down the street the baby hastened,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till he reached the office door:<br>
"I'se a letter, Mr. Postman,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there room for any more?<br>
<p>
'Cause this letter's going to papa;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Papa lives with God, 'ou know:<br>
Mamma sent me for a letter;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Does 'ou fink at I tan do?"<br>
<p>
But the clerk in wonder answered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not to-day, my little man;"<br>
"Den I'll find anozzer office,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Cause I must go if I tan."<br>
<p>
Fain the clerk would have detained him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the pleading face was gone,<br>
And the little feet were hastening,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the busy crowd swept on.<br>
<p>
Suddenly the crowd was parted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;People fled to left and right,<br>
As a pair of maddened horses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment dashed in sight.<br>
<p>
No one saw the baby figure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No one saw the golden hair,<br>
Till a voice of frightened sweetness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang out on the autumn air.<br>
<p>
'Twas too late: a moment only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood the beauteous vision there:<br>
Then the little face lay lifeless<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Covered o'er with golden hair.<br>
<p>
Rev'rently they raised my darling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brushed away the curls of gold,<br>
Saw the stamp upon the forehead<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing now so icy cold.<br>
<p>
Not a mark left the face disfigured,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Showing where a hoof had trod;<br>
But the little life was ended&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Papa's letter" was with God.<br>

<center><b>Polly's Letter to Brother Ben</b></center><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Brother Ben,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I take my pen<br>
To tell you where,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And how, and when,<br>
I found the nest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of our speckled hen.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She would never lay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a sensible way,<br>
Like other hens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the barn or the hay;<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But here and there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And everywhere,<br>
On the stable floor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wood-house stair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And once on the ground<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her eggs I found.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But yesterday<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran away,<br>
With mother's leave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the barn to play.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun shone bright<br>
On the seedy floor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the doves so white<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were a pretty sight<br>
As they walked in and out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the open door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With their little red feet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And their features neat,<br>
Cooing and cooing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I went out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To look about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the platform wide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where side by side<br>
I could see the pig-pens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In their pride;<br>
And beyond them both,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On a narrow shelf,<br>
I saw the speckled hen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hide herself<br>
<p>
Behind a pile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hoes and rakes<br>
And pieces of boards<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And broken stakes.<br>
"Ah! ha! old hen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have found you now,<br>
But to reach your nest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know how,<br>
Unless I could creep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or climb or crawl<br>
Along the edge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the pig-pen wall."<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And while I stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In a thoughtful meed,<br>
The speckled hen cackled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As loud as she could,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And flew away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as to say,<br>
"For once my treasure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is out of your way."<br>
I did not wait<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A moment then:<br>
I couldn't be conquered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By that old hen!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But along the edge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the slippery ledge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I carefully crept,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the great pigs slept,<br>
And I dared not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;even look to see<br>
If they were thinking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of eating me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But all at once,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, what a dunce!<br>
<p>
I dropped my basket<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the pen,<br>
The one you gave me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brother Ben;<br>
There were two eggs in it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way,<br>
That I found in the manger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the hay.<br>
Then the pigs got up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ran about<br>
With a noise between<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A grunt and a shout.<br>
<p>
And when I saw them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rooting, rooting,<br>
Of course I slipped<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lost my footing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tripped,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And jumped,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally fell<br>
Right down among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pigs pell-mell.<br>
For once in my life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I was afraid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the door that led<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out to the shed<br>
<p>
Was fastened tight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With and iron hook,<br>
And father was down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fields by the brook,<br>
Hoeing and weeding<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His rows of corn,<br>
And here was his Polly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So scared and forlorn,<br>
But I called him, and called him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As loud as I could.<br>
I knew he would hear me&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He must and he should.<br>
<p>
"O father! O father!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Get out, you old pig).<br>
O father! oh! oh!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For their mouths are so big.<br>
Then I waited a minute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And called him again,<br>
"O father! O father!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in the pig pen!"<br>
And father did hear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he threw down his hoe,<br>
And scampered as fast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As a father could go.<br>
<p>
The pigs had pushed me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to the wall,<br>
And munched my basket,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eggs and all,<br>
And chewed my sun-bonnet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into a ball.<br>
And one had rubbed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His muddy nose<br>
All over my apron,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean and white;<br>
<p>
And they sniffed at me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stepped on my toes,<br>
But hadn't taken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The smallest bite,<br>
When father opened<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The door at last,<br>
And oh! in his arms<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He held me fast.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

THE two greatest educating powers in the ancient world were Pictures
and Poetry&mdash;the two greatest educating powers are pictures and
poetry still, and pictures and poetry blended in an interesting
manner is the intended educating feature of this
PLEASANT-LEARNING-LAND, but my object in this place is to speak of
pictures only, as perhaps the greatest of all educating powers, and
to demonstrate that they are not sufficiently used for educational
purposes. Firstly: pictures are in a universal language&mdash;when
they
are true to nature every person on the earth can understand them.
Show a picture of a person or a bird, a horse or a house, a ship, a
tree, or a landscape, and everyone knows what is meant, and this is
why most of the peoples of the ancient world conveyed their ideas in
picture language. FLETCHER, in his <i>Cyclopedia of Education</i>,
says:&mdash;
"It has long been accepted as an axiom that the best explanation of a
thing is the sight and study of the thing itself, and the next best a
true picture of the thing." DRYDEN, speaking of poetry and painting
says:&mdash;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The poets are confined to narrow space,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To speak the language of their native
place;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The painter widely stretches his command,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>His pencil speaks the tongue of every
land</i>."<br>
<p>
Many writers, ancient and modern, have taught the great educational
power of pictures. HORACE says:&mdash;A picture is a poem without
words".
SYDNEY SMITH says:&mdash;"Every good picture is the best of sermons
and
lectures." O. S. FOWLER says:&mdash;"A single picture often conveys
more
than volumes." W. M. HUNT says:&mdash;"From any picture we can learn
something." HENRY WARD BEECHER says:&mdash;"A picture that teaches any
affection or moral sentiment will speak in the language which men
understand, without any other education than that of being born and
of living." GARRICK, speaking of Hogarth, says:&mdash;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"His pictured morals mend the mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And through the eye improve the heart."<br>
<p>
But pictures are not only a means of education, for they bring
pleasure, comfort, and education combined. STEELE
says:&mdash;"Beautiful
pictures are the entertainment of pure minds." G. P. PUTMAN
says:&mdash;
"How many an eye and heart have been fascinated by an enchanting
picture." CICERO says:&mdash;"The eyes are charmed by pictures, and
the
ears by music." JOHN GILBERT says:&mdash;"Pictures are consolers of
loneliness; they are a sweet flattery to the soul, they are a relief
to the jaded mind; they are windows to the imprisoned thought; they
are books, they are histories and sermons, which we can read without
the trouble of turning over the leaves." UGO FOSCOLIO says:&mdash;
"Pictures are the chickweed to the gilded cage, and make up for the
want of many other enjoyments to those whose life is mostly passed
amid the smoke and din, the bustle and noise of an overcrowded city."
PANDOLFINI says:&mdash;Many an eye has been surprised into moisture by
pictured woe and heroism; and we are mistaken if the glow of pleasure
has not lighted in some hearts the flame of high resolve, or warmed
into life the seeds of honorable ambition."
<p>
Many pictures, particularly portraits, by bringing up reminiscences,
are a great source of consolation. In millions of houses the
most-loved and treasured possession is the photographic album
containing the likenesses of dear absent or departed friends. SHEE,
writing of the soothing influences of the portrait, says:&mdash;
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mirror divine! which gives the soul to
view,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflects the image, and retains it too!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Recalls to friendship's eye the fading
face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Revives each look, and rivals every grace:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In thee the banished lover finds relief,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His bliss in absence, and his balm in
grief:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Affection, grateful, owns thy sacred
power,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The father feels thee in affliction's
hour;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When catching life ere some lov'd cherub
flies.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To take its angel station in the skies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The portrait soothes the loss it can't
repair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sheds a comfort, even in despair."<br>
Or&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The widow'd husband sees his sainted wife<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In pictures warm, and smiling as in
life,&mdash;<br>
And&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While he gazes with convulsive thrill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And weeps, and wonders at the semblance
still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>He breathes a blessing on the pencil's
aid,</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>That half restores the substance in the
shade</i>."<br>
<p>
But it is more particularly with pictures as a direct means of
education that I have to speak. MR. STEAD holds that in the coming
education of the world the magic lantern will play a very great part,
for through its aid you can portray any object you
wish&mdash;pictures of
scenery, of buildings, of distant countries, of the microscopic
world, and in fact any kind of pictures you choose, in a most
beautiful, life-like, interesting, and educational manner. I think
and earnestly hope that MR. STEAD'S prediction will be fulfilled.
<p>
There are two other ways which I think that pictures should be used
for educational purposes. Firstly, in books, as in this one, and
secondly, on the walls of buildings&mdash;outside and inside if you
like
&mdash;but I will speak only of the inside in this paper. Why should
not
every room of every house be covered with pictures where it is not
covered with furniture? In millions of rooms there is a great waste
of opportunity. Many times I have thought why do they not have
varying patterns of different scenery, etc, in the different rooms of
the houses instead of the wall paper, with its uninteresting pattern
perpetually repeated. There is no reason why a house of twelve rooms
should not represent on its walls twelve different countries, or
twelve histories of striking events, etc. Possibly this may take
place later on. With respect to hanging pictures everywhere on the
walls, it may be objected that it would be too expensive&mdash;so it
would if they were costly pictures&mdash;but really good pictures are
produced by the million now so cheaply, that the objection of expense
vanishes. The walls can be covered now almost as cheaply with
intellectual pictures as with unintellectual wall paper. SIR JOSHUA
REYNOLDS says:&mdash;"A room hung with pictures, is a room hung with
thoughts." JOHN GILBERT says:&mdash;"A room with pictures in it, and a
room without pictures, differ by nearly as much as a room with
windows and a room without windows; for pictures are loopholes of
escape to the soul, leading it to other scenes and to other spheres,
as it were, through the frame of an exquisite picture, where the
fancy for a moment may revel, refreshed and delighted."
<p>
I was convinced many years ago of the almost criminal waste of wall
space, and issued the following doggerel lines, partly from trade and
partly from sentimental motives:&mdash;

Even in the poorest houses pictures must always be a blessing. Many a
poor man's cheerless home would be made much more comfortable and
endurable if a few shilling's worth of good pictures were posted or
hung round its bare walls. If houses were universally decorated with
true speaking pictures what an immense influence for good it would
bring them. What intellectual and refined tastes it would create and
nurture. One most important thing in selecting pictures to cover the
walls it to always choose good subjects. A poor picture takes up as
much room as a good one, and generally costs as much. Always choose
live speaking pictures that will interest and instruct. There is an
immense multitude of poor, tame, an uninteresting pictures produced
in the world, and which in millions of instances keep out the good
ones. If these poor ones could be kept back or destroyed, and the
best ones only take their place, the world would be better for it.
In choosing materials to build up a bright, happy home, always select
the best&mdash;the best books&mdash;the best music&mdash;the best
pictures. In
conclusion, there is one more suggestion I would make on the picture
question, and I think it is the most important of all; it is that a
good clear map of the world should be hung in every house in the
world, to give every person an idea of the world they live in. For it
is a most deplorable fact that ninety-nine out of every hundred of
the inhabitants, even of the civilized world, have a very poor
conception of the geography and ethnology of the world. And this
should not be, for every person ought to have a clear idea of their
world-fatherland, and of their fellow creatures, and a knowledge of
the map of the world is the first lesson to be learned in that most
desirable direction.

<center><b>Old Man and His Wife</b></center><br>
<p>
There was an old man who lived in a wood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As you may plainly see,<br>
He said he could do as much work in a day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As his wife could do in three.<br>
<p>
"With all my heart," the old woman said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"If that you will allow;<br>
To-morrow you'll stay at home in my stead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'll go drive the plough.<br>
<p>
"But you must milk the Tidy cow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear she may go dry.<br>
And you must feed the little pigs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That are within the sty;<br>
<p>
"And you must mind the speckled hen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear she lay away;<br>
And you must reel the spool of yarn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I spun yesterday."<br>
<p>
The old woman took a whip in her hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And went to drive the plough;<br>
The old man took a pail in his hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And went to milk the cow.<br>
<p>
But Tidy hinched and Tidy flinched,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Tidy broke his nose,<br>
And Tidy gave him such a blow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the blood ran down to his toes.<br>
<p>
"Hi! Tidy! Ho! Tidy! Hi!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tidy! do stand still!<br>
If ever I milk you, Tidy, again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twill be sore against my will."<br>
<p>
He went to feed the little pigs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That were within the sty;<br>
He hit his head against the beam<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he made the blood to fly.<br>
<p>
He went to mind the speckled hen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For fear she'd lay away;<br>
And he forgot the spool of yarn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife spun yesterday.<br>
<p>
So he swore by the sun, the moon, the stars,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the green leaves on the tree,<br>
If his wife didn't do a day's work in her life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She should never be ruled by he.<br>

<center><b>The Funny Old Man</b></center><br>
<p>
There was an old man, and though 'tis not common,<br>
Yet if he said true, his mother was a woman;<br>
And though it's incredible, yet I've been told<br>
He was a mere infant, but age made him old.<br>
Whene'er he was hungry he wanted some meat,<br>
And if he could get it, 'twas said he could eat;<br>
When thirsty he'd drink, if you gave him a pot,<br>
And his liquor most commonly ran down his throat.<br>
He seldom or never could see without light,<br>
And yet I've been told he could hear in the night.<br>
He has oft been awake in the daytime 'tis said,<br>
And has fall'n fast asleep as he lay in his bed.<br>
'Tis reported his tongue always moved when he talked,<br>
And he stirred both his arms and his legs when he
walk'd,<br>
And his gait was so odd, had you seen him you'd burst,<br>
For one leg or t'other would always be first.<br>
His face was the saddest that ever was seen,<br>
For if 'twere not washed it was seldom quite clean;<br>
He showed most his teeth when he happened to grin,<br>
His mouth stood across 'twixt his nose and his chin.<br>
At last he fell sick, as old chronicles tell,<br>
And then, as folk said, he was not very well!<br>
And what is more strange, in so weak a condition,<br>
As he could not give fees, he could get no physician.<br>
What a pity he died; yet 'tis said that his death<br>
Was occasioned at last by the want of his breath.<br>
But peace to his bones, which in ashes now moulder,<br>
Had he lived a day longer he'd been a day older.<br>

<p>
Jack Sprat could eat no fat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife could eat no lean,<br>
And so between them both<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They licked the platter clean.<br>
Jack ate all the lean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan ate all the fat,<br>
The bone they both picked clean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then gave it to the cat.<br>
<p>
When Jack Sprat was young,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He dressed very smart,<br>
He courted Joan Cole,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon gained her heart;<br>
In his fine leather doublet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And old greasy hat,<br>
Oh! what a smart fellow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was little Jack Sprat.<br>
<p>
Joan Cole had a hole<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In her petticoat,<br>
Jack Sprat, to get a patch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gave her a groat.<br>
The groat bought a patch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which stopped the hole,<br>
"I thank you, Jack Sprat,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Says little Joan Cole.<br>
<p>
Jack Sprat was the bridegroom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan Cole was the bride,<br>
Jack said from the church<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His Joan home should ride.<br>
But no coach could take her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The road was so narrow;<br>
Said Jack, "Then I'll take her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Home in a wheelbarrow."<br>
<p>
Jack Sprat was wheeling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His wife by a ditch,<br>
Then the barrow turned over,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in she did pitch.<br>
Says Jack, "She'll be drown'd!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Joan did reply,<br>
"I don't think I shall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the ditch is quite dry."<br>
<p>
Jack brought home his Joan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she sat in a chair,<br>
When in came his cat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That had got but one ear.<br>
Says Joan "I've come home, Puss,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray how do you do?"<br>
The cat wagg'd her tail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And said nothing but "mew."<br>
<p>
Jack Sprat took his gun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And went to the brook;<br>
He shot at the drake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But he killed the duck.<br>
He bought it home to Joan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who a fire did make,<br>
To roast the fat duck<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While Jack went for the drake.<br>
<p>
The drake was swimming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his curly tail,<br>
Jack Sprat came to soot him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But happened to fail.<br>
He let off his gun,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But missing the mark,<br>
The drake flew away<br>
&nbsp;Crying "Quack, quack, quack."<br>
<p>
Jack Sprat to live pretty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now bought him a pig,<br>
It was not very little,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not very big;<br>
It was not very lean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not very fat,<br>
"It will serve for a grunter,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said little Jack Sprat.<br>
<p>
Then Joan went to market<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To buy her some fowls,<br>
She bought a jackdaw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a couple of owls;<br>
The owls were white,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The jackdaw was black,<br>
"They'll make a rare breed,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Says little Joan Sprat.<br>
<p>
Jack Sprat bought a cow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His Joan to please,<br>
For Joan could make<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Both butter and cheese;<br>
Or pancakes or puddings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any fat;<br>
A notable housewife<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was little Joan Sprat.<br>
<p>
Joan Sprat went to brewing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A barrel of ale,<br>
She put in some hops<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That it might not turn stale;<br>
But as for the malt&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She forgot to put that;<br>
"This is a brave sober liquor."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said little Jack Sprat.<br>
<p>
Jack Sprat went to market<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bought him a mare,<br>
She was lame of three legs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An as blind as she could stare.<br>
Her ribs they were bare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For the mare had no fat;<br>
"She looks like a racer,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said little Jack Sprat.<br>
<p>
Jack and Joan went abroad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Puss looked after the house;<br>
She caught a large rat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a very small mouse,<br>
She caught a small mouse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a very large rat,<br>
"You're an excellent hunter,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said little Jack Sprat.<br>
<p>
Now I've told you the story<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of little Jack Sprat,<br>
Of sweet Joan Cole<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the poor one-ear'd cat;<br>
Now Jack he loved Joan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And good things he taught her,<br>
Then she gave him a son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after a daughter.<br>
<p>
Now Jack has got rich,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And has plenty of pelf;<br>
If you know any more<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you may tell it yourself.<br>

There was a cross old man and what do you think,<br>
He lived on nothing but victuals and drink;<br>
Victuals and drink were his principal diet,<br>
Yet this crabbed old man would never be quiet.<br>
<p>
He teased a poor monkey, who lived in a cage,<br>
Till the animal got in a terrible rage,<br>
And seized on his nose with finger so strong,<br>
That it stretched it until it was quite a yard long.<br>

<center><b>The Diverting History Of John Gilpin</b></center><br>
<p>
John Gilpin was a citizen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of credit and renown,<br>
A train-bound Captain eke was he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of famous London town.<br>
John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we have wedded been,<br>
These twice ten tedious years, yet we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No holiday have seen.<br>
<p>
To-morrow is our wedding-day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we then will repair<br>
Unto the "Bell" at Edmonton,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All in a chaise and pair,<br>
My sister and my sister's child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself and children three,<br>
Will fill the chaise, so you must ride<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On horse-back after we.<br>
<p>
He soon replied&mdash;I do admire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of womankind but one,<br>
And you are she, my dearest dear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it shall be done,<br>
I am a linen-draper bold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As all the world doth know,<br>
And my good friend the Calender,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will lend his horse to go.<br>
<p>
Quoth Mrs Gilpin&mdash;That's well said;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for that wind is dear,<br>
We will be furnished with our own,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is both bright and clear;<br>
John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'erjoyed was he to find<br>
That, though on pleasure she was bent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She had a frugal mind.<br>
<p>
The morning came, the chaise was brought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet was not allow'd<br>
To drive up to the door, lest all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should say that she was proud;<br>
So three doors off the post was stayed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where they did all get in,<br>
Six precious souls, and all agog<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To dash through thick and thin.<br>
<p>
Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were never folks so glad,<br>
The stones did rattle underneath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if Cheapside were mad;<br>
John Gilpin at his horse's side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seized fast the flowing mane,<br>
And up he got in haste to ride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But soon came down again.<br>
<p>
For saddle-tree scarce reached had he,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His journey to begin,<br>
When turning round his head, he saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three customers come in;<br>
So down he came&mdash;for loss of time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it grieved him sore,<br>
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would trouble him much more.<br>
<p>
'Twas long before the customers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were suited to their mind,<br>
When Betty, screaming, came down the stairs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wine is left behind."<br>
Good lack! quoth he, yet bring it me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My leathern belt likewise,<br>
In which I bear my trusty sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When I do exercise.<br>
<p>
Now, Mistress Gilpin, careful soul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had two stone bottles found,<br>
To hold the liquor that she loved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And keep it safe and sound,<br>
Each bottle had a curling ear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through which the belt he drew,<br>
And hung a bottle on each side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make his balance true.<br>
<p>
Then over all, that he might be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Equipp'd from top to toe,<br>
His long red cloak, well brush'd and neat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He manfully did throw,<br>
Now see him mounted once again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon his nimble steed,<br>
Full slowly pacing o'er the stones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With caution and good heed.<br>
<p>
But, finding soon a smoother road<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath his well-shod feet,<br>
The snorting beast began to trot,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which gall'd him in his seat,<br>
So, "Fair and softly," John, he cried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But John, he cried in vain;<br>
That trot became a gallop soon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of curb and rein.<br>
<p>
So, stooping down, as needs he must,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cannot sit upright,<br>
&nbsp;He grasp'd the mane with both his hands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And eke with all his might,<br>
His horse, who never in that sort,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had handled been before,<br>
What thing upon his back had got<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did wonder more and more.<br>
<p>
Away went Gilpin, neck or nought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Away went hat and wig,<br>
He little dreamt when he set out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of running such a rig;<br>
The wind did blow, the cloak did fly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like streamer long and gay,<br>
Till, loop and button failing both,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At last it flew away.<br>
<p>
Then might people well discern<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottles he had slung,<br>
A bottle swinging at each side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As had been said or sung,<br>
The dogs did bark, the children scream'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Up flew the windows all,<br>
And ev'ry soul cried out, Well done!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As loud as he could bawl.<br>
<p>
Away went Gilpin&mdash;who but he,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His fame soon spread around&mdash;<br>
He carries weight, he rides a race!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis for a thousand pound!<br>
And still as fast as he drew near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas wonderful to view<br>
How in a trice the turnpike men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their gates wide open flew.<br>
<p>
And now as he went bowing down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His reeking head full low,<br>
The bottles twain behind his back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were shatter'd at a blow;<br>
Down ran the wine into the road,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Most piteous to be seen,<br>
Which made his horses flanks to smoke,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As they had basted been.<br>
<p>
But still he seemed to carry weight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With leathern girdle braced,<br>
For all might see the bottle-necks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still dangling at his waist;<br>
Thus all through merry Islington<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These gambols did he play,<br>
And till he came into the Wash<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Edmonton so gay.<br>
<p>
And there he threw the wash about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On both sides of the way,<br>
Just like unto a trundling mop,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or a wild goose at play.<br>
At Edmonton his loving wife<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the balcony spied<br>
Her tender husband, wond'ring much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see how he did ride.<br>
<p>
Stop, stop, John Gilpin!&mdash;Here's the house&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They all at once did cry,<br>
The dinner waits, and we are tired&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Gilpin&mdash;So am I;<br>
But yet this horse was not a whit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Inclined to tarry there&mdash;<br>
For why? His owner had a house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full ten miles off, at Ware.<br>
<p>
So, like an arrow, swift he flew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shot by an archer strong;<br>
So did he fly&mdash;which brings me to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The middle of my song.<br>
Away went Gilpin, out of breath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sore against his will,<br>
Till at his friend the Calender's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His horse at last stood still.<br>
<p>
The Calender, amazed to see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His neighbour in such trim,<br>
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus accosted him:&mdash;<br>
What news? what news? your tidings tell!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me you must and shall&mdash;<br>
Say why bare-headed you are come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or why you come at all?<br>
<p>
Now, Gilpin had a pleasant wit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And loved a timely joke,<br>
And thus unto the Calender,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In merry guise he spoke&mdash;<br>
I came because your horse would come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I well forbode,<br>
My hat and wig will soon be here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They are upon the road.<br>
<p>
The Calender, right glad to find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His friend in merry pin,<br>
Return'd him not a single word,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But to the house went in.<br>
When straight he came with hat and wig&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A wig that flow'd behind;<br>
A hat not much the worse of wear&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each comely in its kind.<br>
<p>
He held them up, and in its turn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus showed his ready wit&mdash;<br>
My head is twice as big as yours,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They therefore needs must fit.<br>
But let me scrape the dirt away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That hangs upon your face,<br>
And stop and eat, for well you may<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be in a hungry case.<br>
<p>
Said John, It is my wedding-day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world would stare,<br>
If wife should dine at Edmonton,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I should dine at Ware.<br>
So, turning to his horse, he said&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am in haste to dine,<br>
'Twas for your pleasure you came here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall go back for mine.<br>
<p>
Ah, luckless speech, and bootless boast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For which he paid full dear;<br>
For while he spake, a braying ass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did sing most loud and clear,<br>
Whereat his horse did snort as he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had heard a lion's roar,<br>
And gallop'd off with all his might,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he had done before.<br>
<p>
Away went Gilpin, and away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went Gilpin's hat and wig;<br>
He lost them sooner than the first,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For why? they were too big.<br>
Now, Mistress Gilpin when she saw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her husband posting down<br>
Into the country, far away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled out half-a-crown.<br>
<p>
And thus unto the youth she said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That drove them to the "Bell"&mdash;<br>
This shall be yours when you bring back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My husband safe and well;<br>
The youth did ride, and soon did meet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;John coming back again,<br>
Whom in a trice, he tried to stop<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By catching at his rein.<br>
<p>
But, not performing what he meant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gladly would have done,<br>
The frightened steed he frightened more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made him faster run;<br>
Away went Gilpin, and away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went post-boy at his heels&mdash;<br>
The post-boy's horse right glad to miss<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lumbering of the wheels.<br>
<p>
Six gentlemen upon the road,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus seeing Gilpin fly,<br>
With post-boy scamp'ring in the rear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They raised the hue and cry:&mdash;<br>
Stop thief! stop thief!&mdash;a highwayman!<br>
An all and each that pass'd the way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did join in the pursuit.<br>
<p>
And now the turnpike gates again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew open in short space&mdash;<br>
The toll-men thinking as before,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Gilpin rode a race;<br>
And so he did, and won it, too,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he got first to town:<br>
Nor stopp'd till, where he had got up,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He did again get down,<br>
<p>
Now let us sing: Long live the king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Gilpin, long live he;<br>
And when he next doth ride abroad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;May I be there to see.<br>

<p>
Old Mother Goose, when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She wanted to wander,<br>
Would ride through the air<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On a very fine gander.<br>
<p>
Mother Goose had a house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas built of wood,<br>
Where an owl at the door<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For sentinel stood.<br>
<p>
She had a son Jack,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A plain-looking lad,<br>
He was not very good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet very bad.<br>
<p>
She sent him to market;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A live goose he bought;<br>
Here, mother, says he,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It will not go for nought.<br>
<p>
Jack's goose and her gander<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They grew very fond;<br>
They'd both eat together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or swim in one pond.<br>
<p>
Jack found one morning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have been told,<br>
His goose had laid him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An egg of pure gold.<br>
<p>
Jack rode to his mother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The news for to tell,<br>
She call'd him a good boy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And said it was well.<br>
<p>
Hack sold his gold egg<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To a rogue of a Jew,<br>
Who cheated him out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The half of his due.<br>
<p>
Then Jack went a-courting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A lady so gay,<br>
As fair as the lily,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sweet as the May.<br>
<p>
The Jew and the Squire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Came behind his back,<br>
And began to belabour<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sides of poor Jack.<br>
<p>
Then old Mother Goose<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That instant came in,<br>
And turned her son Jack<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into fam'd Harlequin.<br>
<p>
She then with her wand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch'd the lady so fine,<br>
And turn'd her at once<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into sweet Columbine.<br>
<p>
The gold egg in the sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was quickly thrown, when<br>
Jack gave a quick dive,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon got it again.<br>
<p>
The Jew got the goose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which he vow'd he would kill,<br>
Resolving at once<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His pockets to fill.<br>
<p>
Jack's mother came in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And caught the goose soon,<br>
And mounting its back,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew up to the moon.<br>

of the article to the whole human race, he said that every person

Magnate seemed taken aback; he affirmed that the Koran did not
mention the article, and, therefore, he believed that it could not
exist, but had I made a thorough search for it; had I tried the Dey
of Algiers. I answered no! Had I tried the Doge of Venice&mdash;the
Elector of Saxony&mdash;the Begum of Oude&mdash;the Stadholder of
Holland&mdash;
the Peishwa of Poona&mdash;the Nabob of Bengal&mdash;the Caliph of
Bagdad&mdash;
the Inca of Peru, or the great Mogul. I looked at the Grand Mufti in
speechless astonishment; he might as well have asked me if I had
enquired of Pharaoh or Nebuchadnezzer. I shook my head and rushed
from his presence, completely nonplussed, bewildered, frantic. Where
on earth was I to get the article? I had asked, and asked, and asked
again, and was tired of asking. I had travelled fifty thousand miles
by forty different modes of conveyance; consulted in their own
capitals with thirty secular monarchs, governing three-fourths of the
world; and I had with earnest, respectful enquiry approached the
sacerdotal thrones of the spiritual monarchs of the eleven principal
religions of mankind, and yet I could get no tidings of it. What was
I to do? I was now standing in front of the great Mosque at
Constantinople almost frantic with perplexity; some one approached
and handed me a printed announcement. I read it! It sent an
inexpressible thrill through me. I immediately took a steamer

world over to obtain, and what do you think it was? It was a FLYING
MACHINE! I wanted a flying machine, Mr. Cole informed me that he had
not got his machine to fly yet, and that in all the world a machine
was not yet invented that would fly, but that, through the active and
progressive ingenuity of the human intellect, such a machine was
certain to be invented in the future, and as an earnest of his strong
conviction he handed me a document, which ran as follows:&mdash;
<p>
October 31st. 1882<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I, the undersigned, firmly believe that as
man has already made<br>
machines to run over the land and float over the water
faster than<br>
the swiftest animal, so shortly he will make machines to
fly<br>
through the air as fast, and finally faster, than the
swiftest<br>
birds do now. And I hereby offer a bonus of &pound;1,000
to any person<br>
who shall (in consequence of said bonus) within the next
two years<br>
invent a flying machine, to go by Electrical, Chemical,
Mechanical,<br>
or any other means, except by gas, a distance of 100
miles, and<br>
shall come and stop in front of the Book Arcade, Bourke
Street,<br>
Melbourne, Australia, as easily and as safely as a
carriage stops<br>
there now.<br>

A workable flying machine would be the grandest invention of the age.
My offer may not bring it about, but suppose a shilling subscription
was made throughout the civilised world; say twenty million people
gave 1/- each. That would be one million pounds, and offer that as a
bonus for a useful flying machine, that bonus, I am sure, would
produce the article. The shillings would be well spent, and it would
immortalise the twenty million people who put their names down.

My prophecy with regard to flying machines, as may well be seen by
the original statement herewith, was made twenty-eight years before
the French aviator brought his machine to Australia which was on 2nd
November, 1910, or two weeks before his successful flight.
<p>
Subsequently Mr. Hammond flew over the city. He remarked: "I was to
early for breakfast, and just thirty years too late to claim E. W.
Cole's prize of &pound;1,000."
<p>
I believe that the advance of flying machines will be so rapid that
within the next decade they will be used with as much ease and safety
as any other means of present locomotion.
<p>
I will further state that their utility will be so great as to enable
China, with her three hundred millions, to succeed in taking correct
statistics.
<p>
And eventually the velocity with which they will fly may materially
assist in establishing the peace of the world and the Parliament of
Man.
<p>
My prophecy with regard to flying machines was made in 1868, and the
bonus of &pound;1,000 (see previous page) was offered in 1882.

</center>
<p>
It was Mr. E. W. Cole's enthusiasm and belief in the ultimate success
of aerial navigation that induced Miss Linda Cole to fly with Mr.
Hawker, the daring young aviator, at Elsternwick recently. Miss Cole
was perfectly calm and collected when entering the biplane, and
showed no signs of "nerviness." During the flight around St. Kilda,
Brighton and Sandringham, and across the waters of Hobson's Bay, she
conversed freely with Mr. Hawker, and commented on the panoramic
views which unfolded themselves below. Miss Cole, having heard that
Mr. Hawker had some intention of flying on a non-stop journey from
Sydney to Melbourne&mdash;a distance of 500 miles&mdash;was most
anxious to
accompany him, provided the Sopwith biplane would carry two persons
in addition to the tank of petrol which would, of course, be
indispensable. Mr. Hawker, however, says he would not take a
passenger should he undertake the journey. Miss Cole is most anxious
for another sea flight, as she is of opinion that the power to see
through the water to the bottom of the ocean is one of the utmost
importance, as it would, in warfare, enable aviators to locate with
accuracy mines in harbours and any other submerged dangers. Her most
ardent wish is to become a lady aviator, and she is contemplating a
trip to Europe to obtain up-to-date instruction in the aerial art.
<p>
The reason Miss Cole went up was because her father has always taken
a great interest in aviation, and many years ago offered substantial
prizes to constructors of airships. He has ever evinced great faith
in the ultimate triumph of aerial navigation, and she is glad that
his dreams are being realised. Miss Cole went up on Friday, on the
thirteenth of the month. Friday and the number 13 are considered
unlucky; but all big events in her life have been associated with the
number 13.

<center><b>This is perhaps the Choicest Collection of<br>
Boys' Names in the English Language<br></b></center>
<p>
To the Reader.&mdash;I beg to make one very important remark upon this
immense variety of boy's names, and that is:&mdash;Be sure and
preserve
the list carefully, as it will serve from which to choose names for
your sons up to the number of 555, without using the same name over
again. P.S.&mdash;If you should be very, very lucky, and have more
than
555 sons, and want more names, call on Professor Cole, at the Book
Arcade, Melbourne, Australia, and he will give you an extra list.

<center><b>PROCLAMATION BY AUTHORITY.</b></center><br>
<p>
Be it known unto all of you that to find your own portrait and the
fashion of your hat or bonnet, your Christian name and the Alphabet
are used.
<p>
The Alphabet is divided into four parts for the second letter of each
person's name as follows:&mdash;The letters A B C D E F belong to No.
1
portrait in each row, and in the case of the first of the letter A
include such names as Abigail, Ada, Aaron, Abraham, Adolphus. The
letters G H I J K L belong to the second portrait in each row, and in
the case of the second portrait, of the letter A include such name
as Agnes, Alice, Ahaz, Alfred. The letters M N O P Q R belong to the
third portrait of each row, and in the case of the letter A include
such names as Amy, Anna, Arabella, Amos, Andrew, Arthur. The letters
S T U V W X Y Z belong to the fourth portrait in each row, and in the
case of the letter A include such names as Athalia, Augusta, Asa,
Augusta. The same rule is followed with each letter of the Alphabet:
for instance, the first portrait in the row B belongs to such names
as Barbara, Bessie, Bartholomew, Benjamin, and so on throughout the
whole collection of portraits.
<p>
If a woman is looking for her future husband, she must find the
number of her own portrait and then the corresponding number amongst
the men's, and THAT IS TO BE HER HUSBAND: for instance, if her own
portrait is No. 27, No. 27 amongst the men's is the portrait of her
future darling. The same rule is to be followed by the men. If a
man's portrait is No. 93, No. 93 amongst the ladies' IS TO BE HIS
WIFE, his own future angel.

If the persons who consult this oracle are single, the sweetheart
that falls to their lot will be their first husband or wife, and if
they are married it will be their second husband or wife, and if they
have been married twice, it will be their third one, and so on up to
144 times of being married; and after that no one will be allowed to
consult this oracle, look at it, speak of it, or even think about it,
such objectionable persons being entirely excluded from its benefits.
<p>
Persons who consult this oracle must accept the husband or wife that
falls to their lot just the same as if they married them in the usual
way, but if dissatisfied on account of ugliness, dress, or any other
cause the consulter, by doing penance in the shape of a pilgrimage to
a certain place in the exact centre of the world and paying a small
sum, can obtain a DIVORCE.
<p>
The place to which the pilgrimage is to be made is Cole's Book
Arcade, Bourke Street, Melbourne, Australia, where they must buy a
book of some kind, and that act DIVORCES them at once.
<p>
Bashful persons need not mention their pilgrimage to the Book Arcade,
when they purchase the book, unless they choose.
<p>
Anyone having obtained a DIVORCE will be allowed to choose out of 9
other portraits. If the number of the portrait that fell to their lot
was 8, they can choose any other number ending with 8, as 18, 28, 38,
48, 58, 68, 78, 88 and 98, of if their first number was 65 they can
choose from 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 75, 85, 95 and so on; whatever
their number was, they may choose from the corresponding figures
throughout the table.
<p>
If, after making a choice out of the 9 portraits, anyone is still
dissatisfied, by making 10 pilgrimages to the Book Arcade, or by
buying and giving away 10 copies of this Funny Picture Book, they
can claim the indulgence of a GRAND DIVORCE and choose which they
like out of the whole 104 portraits.
<p>
Given under our Royal hand and Seal at the Palace of the Book Arcade,
this 21st day of November, 1890.&mdash;COLE, REX.

<p>
The commonly received notion that a man may marry his first cousin,
but must not marry his second is not true; but it is quite true that
Cole's Book Arcade is in Bourke Street, Melbourne, about half-way
between Swanston and Elizabeth Sts.<p>
The rumour that a Yankee Gentleman had invented a machine to take the
noise out of thunder has turned out not to be true; but it is quite
true that Cole's Book Arcade is open from nine in the morning to ten
at night, every working day in the year.<p>
The fact that Cole's Book Arcade contains 80,000 sorts of books is
not the cause of the sea being salt&mdash;of coca-nuts containing
milk&mdash;
of the growth of big gooseberries, nor of the multitude of great big
fibs told annually about a sea-serpent.<p>
It is not true that cats will suck the breath of children when they
are asleep, but it is quite true that Cole's Book Arcade contains one
interesting cat and 80,000 sorts of interesting books.<p>
N.B.&mdash;The
likeness of Cole's Cat can be seen on page 153.

The idea of a machine to go by perpetual motion is perpetual
nonsense. Multitudes of boys and men have wasted much valuable time
in trying to find it, but they never can, as it is contrary to
natural laws, and therefore impossible; but one certainty of the
future is, that a million useful flying machines will flit hither and
thither; and one certainty of the present is, that while Cole's Book
Arcade contains 80,000 sorts of books, not a single person has yet
been able to come to it for a supply in a flying

Just six pounds and a crown;<br>
And I'm going to sell them, all but five,<br>
At yonder market town;<br>
When fifteen pence a head I'll charge<br>
Above what they cost me,<br>
And thus obtain a sum as large<br>
As I gave for all you see."<br>

Oft sought in the country, much prized in the town?<br>
Like a king, above all, I can boast of a crown;<br>
If not found in the palace, I grace the chateau;<br>
Both the peer and the peasant my usefulness know.<br>
When I've not seen six months I am said to be old;<br>
Though exalted by nobles, I'm bought and I'm sold.<br>
Though ne'er in a sermon, I take part in all chat;<br>
Yet I'm ne'er found in this, but I'm always in that.<br>
I'm seen in most colours, am brown, black, or white,<br>
But am rarely found red and, when good, I am light;<br>
In demand with both sexes, selected with care,<br>
I'm prized by most men and add grace to the fair.<br>
Of no use to my owner when kept in his sight,<br>
I attend him by day, and oft serve him by night;<br>
As his slave I am passive; yet, strange it may sound,<br>
To keep me in order, I'm frequently bound.<br>
My fetters are silken; I'm useless at home,<br>
Though a constant companion whenever you roam;<br>
And, though no enchantment within me doth dwell,<br>
Pray tell me my name&mdash;for in that lies a spell!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A Hat.<br>
<p>
<br>
'Twas born in anguish, 'twas cradled by care,<br>
And has lived ever since in the depths of despair.<br>
It dwells in the valley, it glides on the wave,<br>
It is laid with our ashes when cold in the grave.<br>
In darkness it brightens, in sunshine it dies,<br>
As far from the smile of enjoyment it flies.<br>
In the rainbow it sits, in the stars it has birth,<br>
And with angels descending it visits the earth.<br>
With Adam it dwelt, and so to Paradise came,<br>
But eve knew it not, though it shared in her shame.<br>
It mingles in battle, yet still it loves peace.<br>
It joins in the banquet, the dance, and the chase<br>
From the dream of our childhood it ne'er can depart<br>
And it lies, like a gem, in the core of the heart.<br>
The traveller bears it o'er desert along;<br>
The nightingale loves it, though strange to her song.<br>
On the point of an arrow it cleaves through the air<br>
Yet the pinions of birds cannot follow it there.<br>
The bosom disowns it, yet bright through our tears,<br>
When shed in affection, it ever appears.<br>
The cataract fearfully hurries it on,<br>
But, search it through billows and tempest&mdash;'tis
gone.<br>
From the joys of our mortal existence 'tis driven;<br>
Yet finds an unchanging asylum in heaven.<br>
With the harp of the minstrel it ever shall dwell<br>
And it comes to my lips as I utter "Farewell".<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Letter A.<br>
<p>
<br>
Though grief gives me birth, I'm a stranger to
care.<br>
I scorn the dull earth, and float in the air.<br>
No lover claims me, though I revel in bliss.<br>
I taste of each lip, and melt in each kiss.<br>
I'm an egotist's pride, though in silence I reign;<br>
And, through free from sorrow, I'm always in pain.<br>
Though in laughter ne'er seen, in mirth I delight;<br>
In blindness I grope, though perfect in sight.<br>
In foolishness, Wisdom, and wit I've a place;<br>
Though dwelling in virtue I live in disgrace.<br>
Though frost knows me not, with winter I blend;<br>
And always to ice I'm a capital friend.<br>
I'm never in heat, though I live in the fire.<br>
Though never in want, I'm in every desire.<br>
I am I&mdash;, but the end of my paper I spy;<br>
So I'll wind up my stave and wish you good-by.<br>

<p><br>
<center>Power of Kindness to Animals</center>
<p>
Thousands of pathetic tales could be told of the sufferings of poor
dumb animals and the sympathy of some kind human souls for them. The
following one is from the Secretary of a Humane Society:&mdash;
<p>
The wife of a small country farmer wrote to me: "I can't bear sending
the cattle to market. I always keep out of the way, for every animal
on the place knows me, and they look at me so sadly, and, knowing
what they're going to, I feel sometimes that I'd rather give the
whole thing up, than go on rearing them to be knocked about and
killed.
<p>
"I went to the market once myself to see a young beast being sold,
but I'll never go again. I had fed it with my own hands every day,
till it was like a child. I went to the market-town by train, and the
young bullock was driven by road. I walked a little way out to meet
it, and at last met it coming tramping along, and the drover told me
he had had the greatest difficulty to get it along the last few
miles; it had become so tired. You see it had not had much exercise,
as when you are fattening things, it does not do to let them run
about too much, or they'll 'run all the meat off their bones' again,
as the saying is.
<p>
"When I went to Smithfield, I was ready to faint as I saw the men
shouting and swearing, and slashing away with thick sticks. The poor
things were so confused and knocked about that they didn't know what
to do, and I went up to the man who seemed to be in charge of the
pens that our auctioneer was going to sell from, and asked him if he
would be kind to my poor bullock when it came. He only cursed it an
laughed a mocking laugh, and said, 'Oh, yes, ---- it, I'll be gentle
with it. You wait, missis, and see! Do you think I'm here to coddle
any ---- beasts? If you do, you're ---- well mistaken.'
<p>
"I couldn't bear to see what would happen. I couldn't stand it, so I
went away, and then the men (dealers) simply stood and talked, and
haggled with the farmers; and the drovers shouted and yelled, and
hooted, and knocked the things about, and hit them on the nose and
over the eyes, and poked and prodded them with sharp pointed sticks;
and the dogs yapped and barked, and I never heard a single word of
pity, or saw a sign of pity for the poor, tired, bruised, panting,
and terrified creatures.
<p>
"It was a terribly hot day, and I wandered about the town all the
afternoon, able to think of little else than of my poor bullock, and
of what had become of it, when, as I was going to the station to my
train, I met three or four cattle coming driven along. Suddenly one
of them caught sight of me, and in spite of all the men could do came
rushing up towards me. It was my poor bullock; but, oh, so terribly
altered. I should hardly have known it.
<p>
<i>"It seemed beside itself with joy to see me, and stood by me lowing
so pitifully, as much as to say, 'Oh, I'm so glad I've found you! I
know I'm safe now, and you won't let these awful men carry me off
again'.</i>
<p>
"At last they managed to get it to move on by flogging it savagely,
and, heart-sick and conscience-smitten, I went to the station; and
when I got the money that it was sold for it seemed to me like 'the
price of blood.' But what can I do?
<p>
"I suppose the proper thing is to get hardened and to think nothing
about it, like other people; but it is so dreadful that I can never
go to market to see another of my poor beasts sold."
<p>
<br>
<center>Kind Miss Cobbe</center>
<p>
Miss Frances Power Cobbe gave herself, heart and soul, to the defence
of the animals, not because she loved them more than human beings but
because she could not bear to see the men acting so wickedly towards
them, nor to hear the groans of the helpless victims.
<p>
In the account of her life, written by herself, she says: "It is not
the four legs nor the silky or shaggy coat of a dog which should
prevent us from discerning his inner nature of thought and love;
limited thought, it is true, but an unlimited love. That he is dumb,
is to me only another claim (as it would be in a human child) on my
consideration... Another dog, whom I sent away at one year old to
live in the country, was returned to me eight years afterwards old
and diseased. The poor beast knew me again after a few moments' eager
examination, and uttered <i>an actual scream of joy</i> when I called
her
by name, exhibiting every token of tender affection for me ever
afterwards."
<p>
In her books entitled "Dogs whom I Have Met," she says: "The dog who
really loves his master delights in mere propinquity, likes to lie
down on the floor resting against his feet, better than on a cushion
a yard away, and after a warm interchange of caresses for two or
three minutes asks no more, and subsides into perfect contentment.
That a short tender touch of the dog's tongue to hand or face
corresponds exactly, as an expression of his feelings, to our kisses
of affection, there can be no sort of doubt. All dogs kiss the people
they love."
<p>
Tennyson, when on a visit to Miss Cobbe, bade her go bravely on as
she had begun, and "fight the good fight," by which he meant the
warfare against cruelty in which she was engaged. After his death it
was sad to hear the wail of three dogs, a collie, a Scotch terrier,
and a Russian wolf-hound, constant companions and friends of the
poet. Thousands of dogs have pined, and died of grief, for their
loved masters.
<p>
<br>
<center>At a Bull Fight
<br>
The following is a pathetic narrative entitled "El Moro."
</center>
<p>
A Cadiz letter says: "Notice had been posted on all the public places
that on a certain day the bull called 'El Moro' would be introduced
into the arena, and that, when he should have been goaded to the
utmost fury, a young girl would appear and reduce the animal to quiet
subjection. The people of Cadiz had heard of 'El Moro' as the most
magnificent bull ever brought into the city, and it soon became known
that the girl just advertised was a peasant girl of Espara, who had
petted the bull, and fed it and cared for it during the years of it's
growth. On the appointed day the vast amphitheatre was filled with an
anxious, eager crowd. Several bulls had been killed and dragged away,
and then the flourish of trumpets announced the coming of the hero of
the day. With a deep, terrific roar, 'El Moro' entered upon the
scene. He was truly magnificent; a bovine monarch, black and glossy,
with eyes of fire, dilating nostrils, and wicked-looking horns. The
picadores attacked him warily, hurling their banderillos (small,
dart-like javelins ornamented with ribbons, and intended to jade and
infuriate). The bull had killed three horses offhand, and had
received eight banderillos in his neck and shoulders, when, upon a
given signal, the picadores and matadores suddenly withdrew leaving
the infuriated beast alone in his wild paroxysm of wrath. Presently
a soft musical note, like the piping of a lark, was heard, and
directly afterwards a girl of not more than fifteen years of age,
an the tasteful garb of an Andalusian peasant, and with a pretty
face, sprang lightly into the arena, approaching the bull fearlessly,
at the same time calling his name&mdash;'Moro! Moro! Va voy!' At the
first sound of the sweet voice the animal ceased his fury, and turned
towards the place whence it came, and, when he saw the girl, he
plainly manifested pleasure. She came to his head, and put forth her
hand, which he licked with his tongue. Then she sang a low, sweet
song, at the same time caressing the animal by patting him on the
forehead, and, while she sang, the suffering monarch kneeled at her
feet. Then she stooped and gently removed the cruel banderillos,
after which, with her arms around 'El Moro's' neck, she led him
towards the gate of the torril."

<center><b>Kangaroo</b></center><br>
<p>
The Kangaroo is the largest native animal in Australia. He is about 5
feet high when he sits up, he has a head somewhat like a rabbit's,
his hands or fore feet are small but his hind feet are large, and he
has a very thick tail. He can kick and tear with his sharp hind claws
in a very dangerous manner. He frequently kills dogs with his claws,
but, when he is chased by dogs, if he is near water he makes for it
and often drowns the dogs if they come into the water after him. He
leaps or hops about 15 feet at a time and goes very fast. The mother
carries her young in a pouch, as seen in the picture, and when the
baby kangaroos are frightened they run at once into their mother's
pouch for safety, like any other babies running to their mother.

<center><b>Australian Native Cat</b></center><br>
<p>
It is a wild Cat, generally brown or black with many large and small
white spots on it. It lives on small animals, including birds and
their eggs, and is a great pest to farmers, killing their poultry.

<center><b>Emu</b></center><br>
<p>
The Emu lives upon vegetable food such as fruits, roots, and grass.
It has a great curiosity and is easily tamed. It is very inoffensive
except when violently attacked; then it kicks like a horse. It is
said that its kick will break a man's leg. Its flesh is eaten by the
natives and is said to look and taste like beef. It can run very
fast. It lays from 6 to 12 dark green coloured eggs and its young are
pretty little striped things as in the above picture. It is, next to
the Ostrich, the largest bird in the world, being 5 or 6 feet high,
its colour is a mixture of grey and brown, and its voice has a low
booming sound. It is generally coupled with the Kangaroo in the
Australian Arms.

<p>
The Platypus is sometimes called the Water Mole. It is, perhaps, the
most wonderful animal in the world in its combination, being part
bird, part beast, part fish. It has a bill like a duck; five toes
with claws and webbed feet; it is covered with thick glossy fur like
a seal; it has cheek pouches like a monkey to keep it's food in; it
lays two eggs, its voice resembles that of a young puppy, and the
young platypuses play like puppies; it lives in rivers and makes
burrows often 20 or 30 feet long; it feeds upon water insects, shell
fish, etc.

<center><b>Native Bear</b></center><br>
<p>
The Australian Native Bear is a dear little harmless fellow, and is
easily tamed. He lives in the gum trees, feeds upon gum leaves, and
loves his mother who carries him on her back and is very fond of him.
He has a thick fluffy coat, big bushy ears, and no tail. He cries
like a child if he misses his mother. The cry very pathetically if
they are wounded, which they frequently are in the bush, by cruel
wicked boys and men who think it is sport to shoot at the poor
harmless creatures.

<center><b>Bower Bird</b></center><br>
<p>
The Australian Bower Bird is an extensive builder; it not only builds
its nest in a tree but it builds a palace on the ground in the shape
of a bower hut, furnishes it with nick-nacks such as shells, bones,
pieces of mineral, metals, bright parrots' feathers and other
trifles. What the English magpie would steal and hide away the Bower
Bird openly decorates his pavilion with. Often several birds collect
together and play like children, running in, out, and around their
wonderful bower-palace as shown in our picture.

<center><b>Lyre Bird</b></center><br>
<p>
The Australian Lyre Bird is a most beautiful creature, said to be a
variety of the Bird of Paradise. It runs very quickly, and springs
very high, and calls very loudly. It lays but one egg a year and,
consequently, only has one baby per annum. It is a great mimic. Mr.
Metcalfe in his "Australian Zoology", describing it, says: "It is a
consummate mimic and ventriloquist. It imitates to perfection the
notes of all other birds, the united voices of a flock of parrakeets,
the barking of dogs, the sawing of timber and the clink of the
woodman's axe. This it has earned for itself the title of the
Australian Mocking Bird."

The Pussy-cat says, "Come out if you dare;<br>

"Squeak," said the little Mouse; "squeak, squeak,
squeak,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said all the little ones too;<br>
"We never creep out when cats are about,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we're afraid of you."<br>
So the cunning old Cat lay down on a mat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the fire in the servants' hall:<br>
"If the little Mice peep, they'll think I'm asleep;"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So she rolled herself up like a ball.<br>
"Squeak," said the little Mouse, "we'll creep out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And eat some Cheshire cheese,<br>
That silly old Cat is asleep on the mat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we may sup at our ease."<br>
Nibble, nibble, nibble went all the little mice,<br>

<center><b>Dame Trot</b></center><br>
<p>
Dame Trot once went to a neighbouring fair.<br>
And what do you think she bought herself there?<br>
A pussy! the prettiest ever was seen;<br>
No cat was so gentle, so clever and clean.<br>
<p>
Each dear little paw was as black as a sloe,<br>
The rest of her fur was white as the snow,<br>
Her eyes were bright green, and her sweet little face<br>
Was pretty and meek, full of innocent grace.<br>
<p>
Dame Trot hurried home with this beautiful cat;<br>
Went upstairs to take off her cloak and her hat;<br>
And when she came down she was astonished to see<br>
That Pussy was busy preparing the tea.<br>
<p>
"Oh, what a strange cat!" thought poor little Dame
Trot,<br>
"She'll break my best china and upset the pot."<br>
But no harm befell them: the velvety paws<br>
Were quite sure; the Dame for alarm had no cause.<br>
<p>
Next morning when little Dame Trot came downstairs,<br>
To attend as usual, to household affairs,<br>
She found that the kitchen was swept up as clean<br>
As if Puss a regular servant had been.<br>
<p>
The tea stood to draw, and the toast was done brown;<br>
The Dame very pleased to her breakfast sat down;<br>
While Puss by her side on an armchair sat up,<br>
And lapped her warm milk from a nice china cup.<br>
<p>
Now Spot, the old house-dog, looked on in amaze,<br>
He'd never been used to such queer cattish ways,<br>
Put Puss mewed so sweetly, and moved with such grace,<br>
That Spot at last liked her, and licked her white
face.<br>
<p>
Poor little Dame Trot had no money to spare,<br>
And only too often her cupboard was bare;<br>
Then kind Mrs Pussy would catch a nice fish,<br>
And serve it for dinner upon a clean dish.<br>
<p>
The rats and the mice, who wished Pussy to please,<br>
Were now never seen at the butter and cheese;<br>
The Dame daily found that their numbers grew thinner,<br>
For Puss ate a mouse every day for her dinner.<br>
<p>
If Puss had a weakness, I need but confess<br>
'Twas a girl of the period's fancy for dress,<br>
Her greatest desire a high chignon and hat,<br>
And a very short dress <i>a la mode</i> for a cat.<br>
<p>
So one day when Dame Trot had gone out to dine,<br>
Puss dressed herself up, as she thought, very fine,<br>
And coaxed kind old Spot, who looked at her with
pride,<br>
To play pony for her, and give her a ride.<br>
<p>
Now Spot, who to welcome his mistress desired,<br>
And to "company manners" had never aspired,<br>
Jumped up to fawn on her&mdash;and down came the cat,<br>
And crushed, in her tumble, her feather and hat.<br>
<p>
"Oh, puss!" said Dame Trot, "what a very sad mess!<br>
You'd best have remained in your natural dress;<br>
The graces which Nature so kindly bestows<br>
Are more often hid than improved by fine clothes.<br>

The duck was good-natured, and she ran away;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;With her back up sat,<br>
And said she intended to stay;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she showed him her paws,<br>

<center><b>The Story of a Little Mouse:<br></b>
Or, Our Happy Family.<br></center>
<p>
Once there was a little mouse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who came to live in our house;<br>
She came because she was terribly frighten'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To stay outside as it thunder'd and
lighten'd.<br>
<p>
When she came in 'twas nearly dark,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ponto he began to bark;<br>
But she ran round at a rapid rate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then darted in behind the grate.<br>
<p>
Ponto smelt, and sniff'd, and bark'd and scratch'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Mousey was safe and couldn't be
catch'd;<br>
So Ponto, when tired laid down to sleep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Mousey quite quiet determined to keep.<br>
<p>
Mousey stayed there a month, as she thought it was
better,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ponto could smell her, but never could
get her,<br>
But every morning when Ponto went out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Mousey crept forth, and for crumbs
looked about.<br>
<p>
Now one day as Ponto came into the house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinks he, I'll be KIND to that poor little
mouse;<br>
"So come out Miss Mousey," our Ponto he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And if anyone hurts you I'll bite off his
head."<br>
<p>
So the poor little mouse came out of the grate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ate with our Ponto out of his plate,<br>
And always when Ponto laid down on the mat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside him Miss Mousey in her little chair
sat.<br>
<p>
But one rainy night as Miss Mousey sat still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing called a bat, came over the hill;<br>
But Ponto says to him, "You are not wanted here,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sent the bat off with a flea in his
ear.<br>
<p>
The very same night as they lay on the mat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What should come rushing in but a great big
rat;<br>
Up jumped Mr. Ponto and gave a loud bark,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that rat scampered off out into the
dark.<br>
<p>
They had just got rid of the bat and the rat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And what should come in but a GREAT TOM
CAT;<br>
Came jumping, springing, and bounding along,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And frightened Miss Mousey more than a
gong.<br>
<p>
He raced after mousey, around, in and out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the house and the yard, and all round
about;<br>
To the East, to the West, to the North, to the South,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And at last caught her up in his great big
mouth.<br>
<p>
He squeezed her back hard and frighten'd her so,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She scarcely could say, "O, please let me
go!"<br>
But Tom spoke and said, "Mouse is very good meat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as I feel hungry, why, it's you I shall
eat."<br>
<p>
Tom let her go once, but caught her afresh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Mousey made a most desperate
dash;<br>
And again Mousey pleaded, "Oh, please let me go";<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Tom only answered, "Decidedly No!"<br>
<p>
But as luck should now have it, our Ponto came in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And asked Mr. Puss, "What's this horrible
din?"<br>
Says Puss to our Ponto, "I've caught this sly thief,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I intend to bring her to grief."<br>
<p>
Says Ponto to Puss, "The mouse is my friend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you would hurt her, why I must
defend<br>
That nice little, kind little, good little mouse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as she ever remains in this
house."<br>
<p>
Says Pussy to Ponto, "I pray you don't fret;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll love and I'll cherish your poor little
pet;<br>
She shall sleep on the mat, and we'll find her in
food,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she is nice and because she is
good."<br>
<p>
So the nice little mouse, the dog and the cat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;all three ate together, and slept on the
mat;<br>
They sung, danc'd and romp'd with joy and merry
laughter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the old take says, "Lived happy ever
after."<br>

<center><b>History of Mr. Tom Puss And The Rats</b></center><br>
<p>
Mrs. Puss stayed at home, minded and played with young Master John
Puss, Miss Mary Puss, and Baby Puss, while Mr. Puss went out to get
them something to eat. He went into a barn, tied a piece of cheese to
the tip of his tail, and put it through a hole in a door, thinking
that he would catch a rat that way. Some very knowing rats on the
other side of the door got a piece of string, tied it to his tail,
pulled all together, and made Mr. Puss me-ow very loud, and he found
that instead of his catching a rat, the rats had caught him. Mrs.
Puss, finding that Mr. Puss did not come home, put little John Puss
and Mary Puss to bed without any supper, and then sang little deaf
Baby Puss off to sleep by means of the ear trumpet. The rats ate
their supper off Mr. Puss's tail, and then let him go. You see what a
fine long tail he had when he put it through the hole to catch rats
in that foolish manner; and look at his short tail now, in the corner
of the page.

<center><b>Puss In Boots</b></center><br>
<p>
Once upon a time there was a miller who had three sons. When he was
dying he left each of them a legacy. To his eldest son he left his
mill; to his second his ass; and to his youngest his cat. The poor
boy was very sad when he found that he had nothing belonging to him
but a cat; but, to his great surprise, puss jumped on the table and
said in a friendly manner: "Do not be sad, my dear master, only buy
me a pair of boots and a bag and I'll provide for you and myself." So
the miller's son, who had a shilling or two in his pocket, bought a
smart little pair of boots and a bag, and gave them to puss, who put
some bran and sow-thistles into his bag, opened the mouth of it, and
lay down in a rabbit warren. A foolish young rabbit jumped into it;
puss drew the string and soon killed it. He went immediately to the
palace with it. He found the king and queen sitting on the throne,
and, bowing low, he laid the rabbit at the king's feet, saying:
"Please, your majesty, my master, the Marquis de Carabas, has sent
you a rabbit from his warren, as a mark of respect." "I am much
obliged to the Marquis," said the king, and he ordered the rabbit to
be taken to the cook, and a piece of money to be given to the cat.
<p>
During two or three months the cat continued to carry game every now
and then to the king, which was supposed to be the produce of his
master's sport. One day when he happened to hear the king was going
to take a drive on the banks of the river, in company with his
daughter, who was the most beautiful princess in the world, puss
desired the master to go and bathe in the river at the spot that he
should point out, and leave the rest to him. The Marquis of Carabas
did as his cat advised him. Just as he was bathing the king came
past, when the cat bawled out as loud as he could&mdash;"Help! help!
or
the Marquis of Carabas will be drowned!" On hearing this, the king
looked out of the carriage window, and recognising the cat, ordered
his bodyguards to fly to the assistance of my Lord Marquis of
Carabas. As the poor Marquis was being fished out of the river, the
cat informed his majesty that, while his master was bathing, some
robbers had stolen his clothes. The king immediately ordered the
gentlemen of his wardrobe to fetch one of his most sumptuous dresses.
No sooner had this been done and the Marquis suitably attired, then
he looked to such advantage that the king took him to be a very fine
gentleman; while the princess was so struck with his appearance, that
at once she became head and ears in love with him.
<p>
The king insisted that the Marquis should get into the carriage. The
cat, highly delighted at the turn thinks were taking, now ran on
before, and having reached a meadow where there were some peasants,
he thus accosted them; "I say, good folks, if you do not tell the
king that this field belongs to the Marquis of Carabas, you shall all
be chopped as fine as mince-meat." The king did not fail to inquire
of the peasants to whom the meadow belonged? "To the Marquis of
Carabas, please your majesty," said they in a breath.
<p>
And the cat kept running on before the carriage, and repeating the
same instructions to all the labourers he met with, so that the king
was astonished at the vast possessions of the Marquis of Carabas.
<p>
At length the cat reached a magnificent castle belonging to a giant
who was immensely rich. The cat having inquired what sort of person
the giant might be, and what he was able to do, sent in a message to
request leave to speak with him.
<p>
The giant received him civilly. "I have been told," said the cat,
"that you have the power of transforming yourself into all sorts of
animals." "So I have," replied the giant, "and to prove the truth of
what I say you shall see me become a lion." When the cat beheld a
lion standing before him, and saw the monster quietly light his pipe,
he was seized with such a panic that he clambered up to the roof.
After a time, the cat perceiving that the giant had returned to his
natural shape, came down again.
<p>
"And do you possess the power of assuming the shape of the smallest
animals likewise?" "You shall see;" and the giant immediately assumed
the shape of a mouse, when the cat pounced upon him and ate him up.
<p>
By this time the king had reached the gates of the Giant's
magnificent castle, and expressed a wish to enter so splendid a
building. The cat ran out to meet the king, saying&mdash;"Your
majesty is
welcome to the Marquis of Carabas's castle."
<p>
The king was so delighted with the Marquis of Carabas, that he
accepted him as a son-in-law, and that very same day he was married
to the princess.
<p>
The cat became a great lord, and ever after hunted mice only for his
own amusement.

<center><b>Monkey And The Cats</b></center><p>
Two hungry cats having stolen some cheese, could not agree between
themselves how to divide their booty; therefore they went to the law,
and a cunning monkey was to decide their case.
<p>
"Let us see," said the judge (with as arch a look as could be); "ay,
ay, this slice truly outweighs the other;" and with this he bit off a
large piece, on order, as he told them, to make a fair balance.
<p>
The other scale had now become too heavy, which gave this upright
judge a pretence to make free with a second mouthful.
<p>
"Hold, hold!" cried the two cats; give each of us our share of what
is left and we will be content.
<p>
"If you are content," said the monkey, "justice is not; the law, my
friends, must have it's course."
<p>
Upon this he nibbled first one piece and then the other, till the
poor cats, seeing their cheese in a fair way to be all eaten up, most
humbly begged him not to put himself to any further trouble, to give
them what still remained.
<p>
"Ha! ha! ha! not so fast, I beseech you, good ladies," said the
monkey; "we owe justice to ourselves as well as to you: and what
remains is due to me as the lawyer." Upon this he crammed the whole
into his mouth at once, and very gravely broke up the court.
<p>
This fable teaches us that it is better to put up with a trifling
loss, than to run the risk of losing all we have by going to the law.

<center><b>Dick Whittington And His Cat</b></center><br>
<p>
There was once a Lord Mayor of London, whose name was Sir Richard
Whittington. He rose to that office from being a poor orphan, living
in a distant village. Dick was a sharp boy, and was always picking up
knowledge from some of the villagers. Dick heard of the great City of
London; he often heard it said that the streets were paved all over
with gold.
<p>
One day seeing a waggon and team of horses on the road to London; he
took courage and asked the waggoner to let him walk by his side.
Having gained permission, they set off together. When Dick got to
London, he was very eager to see the fine streets paved all over with
gold, but the poor boy saw nothing but dirt instead of gold, so he
crouched down at the door of one Mr. Fitzwarren, a great merchant.
Here he was soon found by an ill-tempered cook, who ordered him to go
about his business. But just at this moment Mr. Fitzwarren himself
came home, and finding that the poor boy was willing to work, he took
him into his house, and said that he should be kept to do what dirty
work he was able for the cook. The cook was always scolding him from
morning till night, and was very cruel to him. Poor Dick had another
hardship. His bed was places in a garret where there were great
numbers of rats and mice, which ran over his face, and made a great
noise. Dick at last bought a cat which was famous for being an
excellent mouser.
<p>
Soon after this, the merchant, who had a ship ready to sail, asked
his servants if they would send any goods abroad. All the servants
mentioned something they were willing to venture but poor
Whittington, who said he had nothing but a cat which was his
companion.
<p>
"Fetch thy cat, boy," said Mr. Fitzwarren, "and let her go." Dick
hesitated for some time; at last he brought poor Puss, and delivered
her to the captain with tears in his eyes. The cook continued to be
so cruel to him that the unhappy fellow determined to leave his
place. He accordingly packed up his few things, and travelled as far
as Holloway, and there sat down on a stone. While he was there
musing, Bow-bells began to ring; and it seemed to him that their
sound said:
<p>
<center>
<i>"Turn again, Whittington,</i><br>
<i>Lord Mayor of London."</i><br>
</center>
<p>
So back went Dick, and got into the house before the cook came down
stairs.
<p>
The ship with Dick's cat on board happened to be driven by contrary
winds on a part of the coast of Barbary, inhabited by Moors, who
showed great eagerness to purchase the things with which the ship was
laden. The captain seeing this, took patterns of the choicest
articles he had to the King of the Moors. While he was showing them
to him, dinner was brought in, and at once lots of rats and mice came
in and ate up all the dainties. The captain was astonished when the
King told him that this often happened. The captain rushed off at
once to the ship, and brought Puss to the palace. The second dinner
had been brought in, and, as usual, in came the rats and mice; Pussy
at the sight of them sprang out of the captain's arms and killed lots
of them, and the rest ran off to their holes. The King was greatly
pleased with the wonderful Puss, and gave two sackfuls of gold for
the cat, and the captain at once sailed for London. When Mr.
Fitzwarren heard the news, he ordered Dick Whittington to be called,
and showed him all the riches which the captain had brought in
exchange for his cat. Dick was now a rich man, and soon after married
the merchant's daughter, at the very church whose bells seemed to
call him back to London. He grew richer and richer, became Sheriff,
and at length Lord Mayor of London.

Pretty little Kitty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat upon a stile,<br>
Sang a little ditty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To herself for a while,<br>
Watching how the sparrows&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeking grain to eat&mdash;<br>
Dart about like arrows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In among the wheat.<br>
<p>
Pretty little Kitty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Liked the birds to see!<br>
Though it was a pity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They were wild and free.<br>
So she stopped her singing&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Left the stile forlorn;<br>
And went gaily springing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In among the corn.<br>

<p>
Don't talk to me of parties, Nan;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I really cannot go;<br>
When folks are in affliction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They don't go out, you know.<br>
I have a new brown sash, too;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems a pity&mdash;eh?<br>
That such a dreadful trial<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should have come just yesterday!<br>
<p>
The play-house blinds are all pulled down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As dark as it can be;<br>
It looks so very solemn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so proper, don't you see?<br>
And I have a piece of crape<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinned on my dolly's hat,<br>
Tom says it is ridiculous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For only just a cat.<br>
<p>
But boys are all so horrid!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They always, every one,<br>
Delight in teasing little girls<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And kitties, "just for fun."<br>
The way he used to pull her tail&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes me angry now&mdash;<br>
And scat her up the cherry tree,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make the darling "meow!"<br>
<p>
I've had her all the summer.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One day, away last spring,<br>
I heard a frightful barking,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I saw the little thing<br>
In the corner of a fence;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T would have made you laugh outright<br>
To see how every hair stood out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And how she tried to fight.<br>
<p>
I shooed the dog away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she jumped upon my arm;<br>
The pretty creature knew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I wouldn't do her any harm;<br>
I hugged her close, and carried her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To mamma, and she said<br>
She should be my own wee kitty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If I'd see that she was fed.<br>
<p>
A cunning little dot she was,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With silky, soft, grey fur;<br>
She'd lie for hours on my lap,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I could hear her purr;<br>
And then she'd frolic after<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When I pulled a string about,<br>
Or try to catch her tail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or roll a marble in and out.<br>
<p>
Such comfort she has been to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure no one could tell,<br>
Unless some other little girl<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who loves her pussy well.<br>
I've heard about a Maltese cross;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But my dear little kit<br>
Was always sweet and amiable,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never cross a bit!<br>
<p>
But oh, last week I missed her!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I hunted all around;<br>
My darling little pussy-cat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was nowhere to be found.<br>
I knelt and whispered softly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When nobody could see:<br>
"Take care of little kitty, please,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bring her back to me."<br>
<p>
I found her lying yesterday<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the lower shed;<br>
I thought my heart was broken<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When I found that she was dead.<br>
Tom promised me another one;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But even he can see<br>
No other kitty ever will be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the same to me.<br>
<p>
I can't go to your party, Nannie,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maccaroons, you say?<br>
And ice-cream? I know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I ought to try and not give way;<br>
And I feel it would be doing wrong<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To disappoint you so.<br>
Well, if I'm equal to it<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By to-morrow, I may go!<br>

A monkey, being fond of nuts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought he would have some roasted;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Not liking to be toasted?<br>
A poor young cat was passing by,<br>

"Twas no use for poor puss to speak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or offer to deny him,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;And she could not deny him.<br>
So he began to laugh and chat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And show a few grimaces;<br>
Oh! if you had but seen, like me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The contrast of their faces.<br>
<p>
He put some nuts into her paw,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he the fire approaches,<br>
As if a salamander she.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or made of young cockroaches.<br>
The poor cat now began to squall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face the fire attacking;<br>
And sadly too, her paw was burnt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The while the nuts were cracking.<br>
<p>
The monkey having feasted well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Began to snarl and grumble,<br>
That he should be so taken in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With nuts he scarce could mumble.<br>
"Dear me," he said, "how they are burnt,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And at poor pussy looking,<br>
"I cannot think how I could bear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such miserable cooking.<br>
<p>
And what a fuss you make about<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit of warning;<br>
I've often done the thing myself&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There's nothing so alarming.<br>
Now take this for yourself," he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"And next time be less squalling:"<br>
Then gave the cat a hearty cuff,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which sent the poor thing sprawling.<br>
<p>
"Now let me give you this advice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I am one of letters:<br>
Leave off your rude, obstreperous way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are with your betters.<br>
And think yourself well off," he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"That I had mercy on you;<br>
For many would have sent you home<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a dress upon you."<br>

<center><b>To Parents And Schoolmasters</b></center><br>
<p>
I have been blamed for printing and distributing "Mother Hubbard." My
answer is:&mdash;"Old Mother Hubbard" has done more towards the
education
of young children than perhaps any piece of reading in existence.
Amongst the hundreds of millions of English speaking people in all
parts of the earth, there are very few but can repeat a part or the
whole of "Mother Hubbard," and I have seen it somewhat asserted that
it is to be found in almost every home in the civilised world. Its
rude style of poetry tells nothing against it. The child knows
nothing of correct metre: as long as there is a jingling rhyme it is
satisfied. The dog is the domestic animal in millions of families,
and in numberless cases is actually a more loved companion then
brothers and sisters. A simple rhyme, therefore, about this attached,
playful, and constant companion is sure to fascinate the young, and
it has fascinated more than a thousand millions of the little dears.
I firmly believe that it would produce grand results if a pretty
illustrated edition of the principal nursery rhymes were made a
text-book in infant schools. You may try, and try, and try again, to
drive an ordinary dry school-book lesson into the infant mind, and
make very little progress&mdash;it is up-hill work. But take an
illustrated edition of a nursery rhyme, say the "Death of Cock
Robin," or "Mother Hubbard," and call the little one to you, begin to
teach it&mdash;how eagerly, how intently does it begin to learn now!
What
animation in its little eyes! What music in its little, joyous,
interested voice! It learns this lesson ten times as fast as the
other one, and gives you ten times the pleasure in teaching it, and
this kind of teaching gradually and insensibly leads the child into a
love of learning: it interests and sets the young inquiring mind at
work. We all know how much easier it is to do a work we are
interested in than a work we are not. It is just so with the child,
and for that reason I would commence to teach the infant mind with
that which pleased it best, and so gradually create a love for
reading. For years I have allowed numbers of little children, of
their own accord, to stand and read nursery rhymes to themselves, and
to teach other youths to read interesting and instructive fiction,
gratis, in the Book Arcade; and I hold that, by its enticingly
creating a love for reading, which will lead to something higher,
time is one of the best and most effective schools in the country.

<center><b>The Goat and the Swing</b></center><br>
<p>
A little story with a moral<br>
For the young folks who are prone to quarrel.<br>
Old folks are wise, and do not need it,<br>
Of course they, therefore, will not read it.<br>
<p>
A vicious goat, one day, had found<br>
His way into forbidden ground<br>
When coming to the garden-swing,<br>
He spied a most prodigious thing,&mdash;<br>
A ram, a monster, to his mind,<br>
With head before and head behind!<br>
<p>
Its shape was odd&mdash;no hoofs were seen,<br>
But, without legs, it stood between<br>
Two uprights, lofty posts of oak,<br>
With forehead ready for a stroke.<br>
<p>
Though but a harmless ornament<br>
Carved of the seat, it seemed intent<br>
On barring the intruder's way;<br>
While he, advancing, seemed to say,<br>
"Who is this surly fellow here,<br>
Two heads, no tail&mdash;it's mighty queer!<br>
A most insulting countenance!"<br>
<p>
With stamp of foot and angry glance<br>
He curbed he threatening neck and stood<br>
Before the passive thing of wood.<br>
"You winked as I was going by!<br>
You did not? What! tell me I lie?<br>
Take that!" And at the swing he sprung.<br>
<p>
A sounding thump! It backward swung,<br>
And set in motion by the blow,<br>
Swayed menacingly to and fro.<br>
"Ha! you will fight! A quarrelsome chap,<br>
I knew you were! You'll get a rap!<br>
I'll crack your skull!" A headlong jump;<br>
Another and a louder bump!<br>
<p>
The swing, as with kindling wrath,<br>
Came rushing back along the path.<br>
The goat, astonished, shook his head,<br>
Winked hard, turned round, grew mad, and said,<br>
"Villain! I'll teach you who I am!"<br>
(Or seemed to say,)&mdash;"you rascal ram,<br>
To pick a fight with me, when I<br>
So quietly am passing by!<br>
Your head or mine!" A thundering stroke&mdash;<br>
The cracking horns met crashing oak!<br>
<p>
Then came a dull and muffled sound,<br>
And something rolled along the ground,<br>
Got up, looked sad&mdash;appeared to say,<br>
"Your head's too hard!"&mdash;and limped away<br>
Quite humbly, in a rumpled coat&mdash;<br>
A dustier and a wiser goat!<br>

These pictures we hope<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Will our little folks please,<br>
And also to each one<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This moral convey:<br>
"Be contented and happy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever your lot,<br>
And don't try, as some do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To have your own way."<br>
<p>
Master Jacko, you see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had a very snug home,<br>
With plenty to eat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That was wholesome and good;<br>
But still he did not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We are sorry to say,<br>
Behave in a way<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That a pet monkey should.<br>
<p>
For one day he said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, I don't like at all<br>
The life that I lead,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I cannot see why<br>
I should not live just<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As my own master does;<br>
This chain is not strong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I break it? I'll try."<br>
<p>
After some little time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacko snapped it in two;<br>
Said he to himself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, now where shall I go?<br>
To the larder, I think;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For my appetite's good,<br>
And I'm sure to find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Something to eat there, I know."<br>
<p>
He entered, and as he<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was looking about<br>
A lobster just brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shop seized his tail,<br>
And pinched him, and nipped him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until our young friend<br>
Jumped about, and set up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A most piteous wail.<br>
<p>
Next he went to the kitchen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there he espied<br>
A bottle of something&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ha, ha, I must taste!"<br>
But he found it was curry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which burnt his poor throat,<br>
So he let drop the bottle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And he ran off in haste.<br>
<p>
To the dining-room the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He repaired, and he said,<br>
"Into master's tea-pot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hot water I'll pour;"<br>
But he upset the kettle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And scalded himself,<br>
And loudly screamed out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he rolled on the floor.<br>
<p>
Quoth Jacko, "the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn't suit me at all,<br>
I had better go back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the garden again,<br>
And gather some peaches,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or grapes, or some plums,<br>
And try to forget<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All my trouble and pain."<br>
<p>
In the corner the rogue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Saw a bee-hive&mdash;"Why, here<br>
Must be honey! Delicious!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he; "Just the thing!"<br>
So he put in his hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But he brought out the bees,<br>
And they punished poor Jacko<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a sting.<br>
<p>
Pinched, scalded, and stung,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To his home he returned.<br>
Reasoned he, "My past folly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not regret;<br>

<center><b>A Fruitless Sorrow</b></center><br>
<p>
A little monkey,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dusky, ugly, sad,<br>
Sat hopeless, curled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within his narrow cage;<br>
Dark was the stifling room,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No joy he had;<br>
The sick air rang<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With tones of pain and rage.<br>
<p>
From many a prisoned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Creature held for sale,<br>
Stolen from the happy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom of its life:<br>
Dull drooping birds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That uttered shriek and wail,<br>
And beast and reptile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of woe and strife.<br>
<p>
Into the place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A cheerful presence came,<br>
And kind eyes lighted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the monkey small;<br>
Straightway the weary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;World was not the same<br>
Such fortune did<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The little thing befall.<br>
<p>
Safe in a basket<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fastened, he was sent<br>
Across the city,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Trembling and afraid.<br>
But once he saw his new home,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What sweet content<br>
Was his, while petted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And caressed, he played.<br>
<p>
A week of bliss,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! that it should end!<br>
He had forgotten<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Darkness, pain, and all;<br>
But there were monkeys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Finer than our friend,<br>
His master's eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On such a one must fall!<br>
<p>
So fate had ordered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the frisky sprite,<br>
Dun-coloured, grey,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And streaked with cinnamon,<br>
Born in far bright Brazil,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was bought at sight,<br>
And all the first<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor pet's fortune won.<br>
<p>
They brought into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright and cheerful room<br>
The basket small<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In which he had been borne<br>
To such a happy life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw his doom<br>
At once, the misery<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his lot forlorn.<br>
<p>
The moment that<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The basket met his sight,<br>
He dropped his head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And hid his sorrowing eyes<br>
Against his arm,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor looked to left nor right,<br>
As any thinking<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Human creature wise.<br>
<p>
They took him back<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into his noisome den,<br>
His tiny face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Concealed as if he wept,<br>
So helpless to resist.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heroic men<br>
Might such despairing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient calm have kept.<br>
<p>
Poor little thing!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if he lingers yet,<br>
Or death has ended<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Life so hard to bear<br>
I know not;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I never can forget<br>
His brief rejoicing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his mute despair.<br>

<p>
I've a tale to relate.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such a wonderful tale<br>
That really I fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My description must fail;<br>
'Tis about a fine horse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had powers so amazing.<br>
He lived without eating,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or drinking, or grazing;<br>
In fact this fine horse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was so "awfully" clever.<br>
That left to himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He'd have lived on forever.<br>
<p>
He stood in a room,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his nose in the air,<br>
And his wide staring eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking no one knows where.<br>
His tail undisturbed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the sting of a fly<br>
One foot slightly raised<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if kicking he'd try,<br>
This wonderful horse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never slept or yet dozed,<br>
At least if he did so,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes never closed.<br>
<p>
"Come, gee up, old Dobbin.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look sharp, don't you see<br>
I want to be there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And get back before tea?"<br>
But this obstinate horse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never offered to prance,<br>
Or made an attempt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At the slightest advance;<br>
Harry slashed him so hard.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That he slashed off one ear,<br>
Then his mane tumbled off,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And poor Dobbin looked queer.<br>
<p>
With spur, and with whip,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with terrible blows,<br>
He soon was deprived<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one eye, and his nose,<br>
While his slightly-raised foot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found a place on the floor.<br>
The tail once so handsome<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was handsome no more,<br>
And Harry, the tears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Raining down as he stood,<br>
Cried, "Bother the horse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nothing but wood!"<br>

I'd teach my horse a steady pace.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, if he should stumble<br>

His black coat off, and his old clothes on:<br>
"Now  I'm myself," says Farmer John.<br>

Up leaps the dog: "Get down, you pup,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you so glad you would eat me up?"<br>
The old cow lows at the gate to greet him.<br>

Do you get good food when I'm away?"<br>
<p>
"You haven't a rib!" says Farmer John:<br>
"The cattle are looking round and sleek;<br>
The colt is going to be a roan,<br>
And a beauty too, how he has grown!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll wean the calf, next week."<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he slaps old Grey;<br>
"Ah, this is the comfort of going away."<br>
<p>
"For after all," says Farmer John,<br>
"The best of the journey is getting home!<br>
"I've seen great sights, but would I give<br>
This spot, and the peaceful life I live,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all their Paris and Rome?<br>
These hills for the City's stifled air,<br>
And big hotels, all bustle and glare,<br>
Lands all horses, and roads all stones,<br>
That deafen your ears and batter your bones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you, old Bay?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you, old Grey?<br>
That's what one gets by going away."<br>

"I've found out this," says Farmer John,<br>
"That happiness is not bought and sold<br>
And clutched in a life of waste and hurry,<br>
In nights of pleasure and days of worry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wealth isn't all in gold,<br>
Mortgage and stocks, and ten per cent.,<br>
But in simple ways of sweet content.<br>
Few wants pure hopes, and noble ends,<br>
Some land to till and a few good friends,<br>

He panted from his utmost soul,<br>

But first peep'd out with cautious fear,<br>
T' examine if the coast was clear.<br>

To sleep out in the open air.<br>
<p>
The grass felt damp and raw,<br>
Much colder than his master's straw,<br>
Yet on it he was forc'd to stretch,<br>
A poor, cold, melancholy wretch.<br>
<p>
The night was dark, the country hilly,<br>
Poor Dobbin felt extremely chilly;<br>
Perhaps a feeling like remorse<br>
Just now might sting this truant horse.<br>
<p>
As soon as day began to dawn,<br>
Dobbin, with long and weary yawn,<br>
Arose from this his sleepless night,<br>
But in low spirits and bad plight.<br>
<p>
"If this" (thought he) "is all I get,<br>
A bed unwholesome, cold and wet,<br>
And thus forlorn about to roam,<br>
I think I'd better be at home."<br>
<p>
'Twas long ere Dobbin could decide<br>
Betwixt his wishes and his pride,<br>
Whether to live in all this danger,<br>
Or go back sneaking to the manger.<br>
<p>
At last his struggling pride gave way,<br>
To thought of savoury oats and hay<br>
To hungry stomach, was a reason<br>
Unanswerable at this season.<br>
<p>
So off he set, with look profound,<br>
Right glad that he was homeward bound;<br>
And, trotting fast as he was able,<br>
Soon gain'd once more his master's stable.<br>
<p>
Now Dobbin, after his disaster,<br>
Never again forsook his master,<br>
Convinc'd he'd better let him mount.<br>
Than travel on his own account.<br>

<center><b>The Cottager's Donkey</b></center><br>
<p>
No wonder the Cottager<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks with Pride<br>
On the well-fed donkey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That stands at his side;<br>
For he works, and he lives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As hard as he,<br>
And a creature more useful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There cannot be.<br>
<p>
He knows the Cottager's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wife and child,<br>
And he loves to play<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With that dog so wild;<br>
And though sometimes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So staid and still,<br>
He can roll in the meadow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With right good will.<br>
<p>
He knows the road<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the market well,<br>
Where garden vegetables<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes to sell:<br>
And though it is hilly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And far, and rough,<br>
He thinks&mdash;for a donkey,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It's well enough.<br>
<p>
So he trudges along,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And little he cares<br>
How hard he works,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or how ill he fares!<br>
Content when his home<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Appears in sight,<br>
If his kindly master<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiles at night.<br>

<p>
Poor Donkey! I'll give him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A handful of grass;<br>
I'm sure he's an honest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though stupid, old ass.<br>
He trots to the market<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To carry the sack,<br>
And lets me ride all the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Way home on his back;<br>
And only just stops<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the ditch for a minute,<br>
To see if there's any<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fresh grass for him in it.<br>
<p>
'Tis true, now and then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He has got a bad trick<br>
Of standing stock-still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And just trying to kick:<br>
But then, poor old fellow!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You know he can't tell<br>
That standing stock-still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not using me well;<br>
For it never comes into<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His head, I dare say,<br>
To do his work first,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then afterwards play.<br>
<p>
No, no, my good donkey!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll give you some grass,<br>
For you know no better,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you're an ass;<br>
But what little donkeys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some children must look,<br>
Who stand, very like you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock-still at their book,<br>
And waste every moment<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of time as it passes&mdash;<br>
A great deal more stupid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And silly than asses!<br>

<p>
Old Jack was as sleek<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And well looking an ass<br>
As ever on common<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Munched thistle or grass;<br>
And&mdash;though 'twas not gaudy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That jacket of brown&mdash;<br>
Was the pet of the young<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pride of the town.<br>
<p>
And indeed he might well<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look so comely and trim,<br>
When his young master, Joe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was so gentle to him;<br>
For never did child<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More affection beget<br>
Than was felt by young Joe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For his four-footed pet.<br>
<p>
Joe groomed him and fed him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, each market day,<br>
Would talk to his darling<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole of the way;<br>
And Jack before dawn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would be pushing the door,<br>
As though he would say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Up Joe; slumber no more."<br>
<p>
One day Jack was wandering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the roadside,<br>
When an urchin the donkey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maliciously eyed;<br>
And aiming too surely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At Jack a sharp stone,<br>
It struck the poor beast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just below the shin bone.<br>
<p>
Joe soothed and caressed him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And coaxed him until<br>
They came to a stream<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the side of the hill;<br>
And with cool water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He washed the swoll'n limb,<br>
And after this fashion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept talking to him:&mdash;<br>
<p>
"Poor Jack did they pelt him&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The cowards, so sly!<br>
I wish I'd been there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With my stick, standing by:<br>
It doesn't bleed now&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twill be well in a trice;<br>
There, let me just wash it&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now isn't that nice?"<br>
<p>
And Jack nestled down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his soft velvet nose,<br>
And close as he could,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Joe's ragged clothes;<br>
And he looked at his master,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As though he would say&mdash;<br>
"I'm sure I can never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your kindness repay."<br>

<p>
Down in this ditch poor donkey lies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who jogg'd with many a load;<br>
And till the day death clos'd his eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brows'd up and down this road.<br>
<p>
No shelter had he for his head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever winds might blow;<br>
A neighb'ring commons was his bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho' drest in sheets of snow.<br>
<p>
In this green ditch he often stray'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To nip the dainty grass;<br>
And friendly invitations bray'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To some more hungry ass.<br>
<p>
Each market-day he jogg'd along<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the gard'ner's load,<br>
And snor'd out many a donkey's song<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To friends upon the road.<br>
<p>
A tuft of grass, a thistle green,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or cabbage-leaf so sweet,<br>
Were all the dainties, he was seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For twenty years to eat.<br>
<p>
And as for sport, the sober soul<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was such a steady Jack,<br>
He only now and then would roll,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heels upward, on his back.<br>
<p>
But all his sport, and dainties too,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And labours now are o'er.<br>
Last night so bleak a tempest blew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He could withstand no more.<br>
<p>
He felt his feeble limbs grow cold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His blood was freezing slow,<br>
And presently you might behold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Him dead upon the snow.<br>
<p>
Poor donkey! travellers passing by,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy cold remains shall view;<br>
And 'twould be well if all who die<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To duty were as true.<br>

<center><b>The Cow and The Ass</b></center><br>
<p>
Beside a green meadow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A stream us'd to flow,<br>
So clear one might see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The white pebbles below;<br>
To this cooling brook<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The warm cattle would stray,<br>
To stand in the shade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On a hot summer's day.<br>
<p>
A cow, quite oppress'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the heat of the sun,<br>
Came here to refresh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As she often had done,<br>
And standing quite still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaning over the stream,<br>
Was musing, perhaps;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or perhaps she might dream.<br>
<p>
But soon a brown ass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of respectable look<br>
Came trotting up also,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To taste of the brook,<br>
And to nibble a few<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the daisies and grass.<br>
"How d'ye do?" said the cow:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"How d'ye do?" said the ass.<br>
<p>
"Take a seat," cried the cow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gently waving her hand.<br>
"By no means, dear madam,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he, "while you stand."<br>
Then stooping to drink,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a complaisant bow,<br>
"Ma'am, your health." said the ass;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thank you, sir," said the cow.<br>
<p>
When a few of these compliments<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More had been pass'd,<br>
They laid themselves down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the herbage at last;<br>
And waited politely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(As gentlemen must),<br>
The ass held his tongue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the cow might speak first.<br>
<p>
Then, with a deep sigh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She directly began,<br>
"Don't you think, Mr. Ass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We are injured by man?<br>
'Tis a subject that lies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a weight on my mind:<br>
We certainly are much<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oppress'd by mankind.<br>
<p>
"Now what is the reason<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(I see none at all)<br>
That I always must go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When Suke pleases to call?<br>
Whatever I'm doing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;('Tis certainly hard),<br>
I'm forc'd to leave off<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be milked in the yard.<br>
<p>
"I've no will of my own,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But must do as they please,<br>
And give them my milk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make butter and cheese;<br>
I've often a great mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To kick down the pail,<br>
Or give Suke a box<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ears with my tail."<br>
<p>
"But ma'am," said the ass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Not presuming to teach&mdash;<br>
O dear, I beg pardon&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray finish your speech;<br>
I thought you had finish'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed," said the swain,<br>
"Go on, and I'll not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Interrupt you again."<br>
<p>
"Why, sir, I was only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just going to observe,<br>
I'm resolved that these tyrants<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No longer I'll serve;<br>
But leave them for ever<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To do as they please,<br>
And look somewhere else<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For their butter and cheese."<br>
<p>
Ass waited a moment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see if she'd done,<br>
And then, "Not presuming<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To teach," he begun.<br>
"With submission, dear madam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To your better wit,<br>
I own I am not quite<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Convinced by it yet.<br>
<p>
"That you're of great service<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To them is quite true,<br>
But surely they are<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some service to you.<br>
'Tis their pleasant meadow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In which you regale;<br>
They feed you in winter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When grass and weeds fail.<br>
<p>
"And then a warm cover<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They always provide,<br>
Dear madam, to shelter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your delicate hide,<br>
For my own part, I know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I receive much from man,<br>
And for him, in return,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I do all I can."<br>
<p>
The cow, upon this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast her eyes on the grass,<br>
Not pleas'd at thus being<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Reproved by an ass,<br>
Yet, thought she, "I'm determined<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll benefit by't,<br>
For I really believe<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the fellow is right."<br>

<p>
Come, children, listen to me now,<br>
And you will hear about the cow;<br>
You'll find her useful, alive or dead,<br>
Whether she's black, or white, or red.<br>
<p>
When milkmaids milk her morn and night<br>
She gives them milk so fresh and white,<br>
And this we, little children, think<br>
Is very nice for us to drink.<br>
<p>
The curdled milk they press and squeeze,<br>
And so they make it into cheese;<br>
The cream they skim and shake in churns,<br>
And then it soon to butter turns.<br>
<p>
And when she's dead, her flesh is good,<br>
For beef is a very wholesome food,<br>
But though 'twill make us brave and strong,<br>
To eat too much, you know, is wrong.<br>
<p>
Her skin, with lime and bark together,<br>
The tanner tans, and makes into leather,<br>
And without that, what should we do<br>
For soles of every boot and shoe?<br>
<p>
The shoemaker cuts it with his knife<br>
And bound the tops are by his wife;<br>
And so they nail them to the last,<br>
And then they stitch them tight and fast.<br>
<p>
The hair that grows upon her back<br>
Is taken, whether white or black,<br>
And mix'd with plaster, short or long,<br>
Which makes it very firm and strong.<br>
<p>
And, last of all, if cut with care,<br>
Her horns make combs to comb our hair;<br>
And so we learn&mdash;thanks to our teachers&mdash;<br>
That cows are very useful creatures.<br>

While they trembled with fright:<br>

Now the little calf Spot,<br>

For no one, night before,<br>
Saw her shut up the door;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But they said that she did, all the same,<br>

Said the horse (dapple gray),<br>
"I was not up that way<br>

"I suppose," cried the mule,<br>
Some folks think me a fool,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But I'm not quite as simple as that;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor calf never knows what she's at."<br>
<p>
Just that moment, the calf,<br>
Who was always the laugh<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the jest of the yard, came in sight.<br>
"Did you shut my barn door?"<br>
Asked the farmer once more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I did, sir, I closed it last night,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the calf; "and I thought that was
right."<br>
<p>
Then each one shook his head,<br>
"She will catch it," they cried,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Serves her right for her meddlesome
ways."<br>
Said the farmer, "Come here,<br>
Little bossy, my dear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You have done what I cannot repay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And your fortune is made from to-day.<br>
<p>
"For a wonder, last night,<br>
I forgot the door quite,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you had not shut it so neat,<br>
All my colts had slipped in,<br>
And gone right to the bin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And got what they ought not to eat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd have founded themselves on wheat."<br>
<p>
The each hoof of them<br>
All began to loudly to bawl,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The very mule smiled, the cock crew;<br>
"Little Spotty, my dear,<br>
You're a favourite here,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They cried, "we all said it was you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We were so glad to give you your due."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the calf answered knowingly, "Boo!"<br>

<p>
The dew was falling fast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The stars began to blink;<br>
I heard a voice; it said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Drink, pretty creature, drink!"<br>
And looking o'er the hedge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before me I espied<br>
A snow-white mountain lamb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a maiden by its side.<br>
<p>
Nor sheep nor kine were near;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The lamb was all alone,<br>
And by a slender cord<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was tethered to a stone;<br>
With one knee on the grass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the little maiden kneel,<br>
While to this mountain lamb.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave its evening meal.<br>
<p>
"What ails thee, young one; what?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why pull so at thy cord?<br>
Is it not well with thee?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well both for bed and board?<br>
Thy plot of grass is soft,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And green as grass can be;<br>
Rest, little young one, rest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What is't that aileth thee?<br>
<p>
"What is it thou would'st seek?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What is wanting to thy heart?<br>
Thy limbs, are they not strong?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And beautiful thou art.<br>
This grass is tender grass;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These flowers they have no peers;<br>
And that green corn all day long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is rustling in they ears!<br>
<p>
"Rest little young one, rest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hast thou forgot the day<br>
Why my father found the first<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In places far away;<br>
Many flocks were on the hills,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou wert owned by none,<br>
And thy mother from thy side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For evermore was gone.<br>
<p>
"He took thee in his arms,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in pity brought thee home;<br>
Oh! blessed day for thee!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then whither would'st thou roam?<br>
A faithful nurse thou hast;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dam that did the yean<br>
Upon the mountain top<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No kinder could have been.<br>
<p>
"Thou know'st that thrice a day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have brought thee in this can<br>
Fresh water from the brook,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As clear as ever ran.<br>
And twice, too, in the day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the ground is wet with dew,<br>
I bring thee draughts of milk&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Warm milk it is, and new.<br>
<p>
"Here, then, thou need'st not dread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The raven in the sky;<br>
Night and day thou'rt safe;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our cottage is hard by.<br>
Why bleat so after me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Why pull so at thy chain?<br>
Sleep, and at break of day,<br>

<center><b>The Pet Lamb</b></center><br>
<p>
Once on a time, a shepherd lived<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a cottage small;<br>
The grey thatched roof was shaded by<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An elm-tree dark and tall;<br>
While all around, stretched far away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A wild and lonesome moor,<br>
Except a little daisied field<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the trellised door.<br>
<p>
Now, it was on a cold March day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When on the moorland wide<br>
The shepherd found a trembling lamb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By its mother's side;<br>
And so pitiful it bleated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the cold it shook,<br>
He wrapped it up beneath his coat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And home the poor lamb took.<br>
<p>
He placed it by the warm fireside,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then his children fed<br>
This little lamb, whose mother died,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With milk and sweet brown bread,<br>
Until it ran about the floor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or at the door would stand;<br>
And grew so tame, it ate its food<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From out the children's hand.<br>
<p>
It followed them where'er they went,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Came ever at their call,<br>
And dearly was this pretty lamb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beloved by them all.<br>
And often on a market-day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When cotters crossed the moor,<br>
They stopped to praise the snow-white lamb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the cottage door;<br>
<p>
They patted it upon its head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stroked it with the hand,<br>
And vowed it was the prettiest lamb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd seen in all the land.<br>
<p>
Now, this kind shepherd was as ill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As ill as he could be,<br>
And kept his bed for many a week,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing earned he;<br>
And when he had got well again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He to his wife did say,<br>
"The doctor wants his money, and<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't it to pay.<br>
<p>
"What shall we do, what can we do?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor made me well,<br>
There's only one thing can be done,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We must the pet lamb sell;<br>
We've nearly eaten all the bread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And how can we get more,<br>
Unless you call the butcher in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When he rides by the door?"<br>
<p>
"Oh, do not sell my white pet lamb,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then little Mary said,<br>
"And every night I'll go up stairs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without my tea to bed;<br>
Oh! do not sell my sweet pet lamb;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you let it live,<br>
The best half of my bread and milk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will unto it give."<br>
<p>
The doctor at that very time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Entered the cottage door,<br>
As, with her arms around her lamb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat upon the floor.<br>
"For if the butcher buys my lamb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He'll take away its life,<br>
And make its pretty white throat bleed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his sharp cruel knife;<br>
<p>
"And never in the morning light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Again it will me meet,<br>
Nor come again to lick my hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up upon me and bleat."<br>
"Why do you weep, my pretty girl?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor then did say.<br>
"Because I love my little lamb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which must be sold to-day;<br>
<p>
It lies beside my bed at night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, oh, it is so still,<br>
It never made a bit of noise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When father was so ill.<br>
"Oh do not let them sell my lamb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I'll go to bed,<br>
And never ask for aught to eat<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But a small piece of bread."<br>
"I'll buy the lamb and give it you,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind, good doctor said,<br>
"And with the money that I pay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your father can buy bread.<br>
"As for the bill, that can remain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until another year."<br>
He paid the money down, and said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The lamb is yours, my dear:<br>
<p>
You have a kind and gentle heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And God, who made us all,<br>
He loveth well those who are kind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To creatures great and small;<br>
"And while I live, my little girl,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your lamb shall not be sold,<br>
But play with you upon the moor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sleep within the fold."<br>
<p>
And so the white pet lamb was saved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And played upon the moor,<br>
And after little Mary ran<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About the cottage-floor.<br>
It fed upon cowslips tall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And ate the grass so sweet,<br>
And on the little garden-walk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pattered its pretty feet;<br>
<p>
And with its head upon her lap<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The little lamb would lay<br>
Asleep beneath the elm-tree's shade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the summer's day,<br>
While she twined the flowers around its neck,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And called it her, "Sweet May."<br>

<p>
It happened one day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the other pigs tell,<br>
In the course of their walk<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They drew near to a well,<br>
So wide and so deep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With so smooth a wall round,<br>
That a pig tumbling in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was sure to be drowned.<br>
<p>
But a perverse little brother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Foolish as ever,<br>
Still boasting himself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Very cunning and clever,<br>
Now made up his mind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That, whatever befell,<br>
He would run on before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And jump over the well.<br>
<p>
Then away he ran fast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To one side of the well,<br>
Climbed up on the wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Slipped, and headlong he fell;<br>
And now from the bottom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His pitiful shout<br>
Was, "Oh mother! I'm in;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray do help me out!"<br>
<p>
She ran to the side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When she heard his complaint,<br>
And she then saw him struggling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Weakly and faint,<br>
Yet no help could she give!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But, "My children," cried she,<br>
"How often I've feared<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sad end his would be!"<br>
<p>
"Oh, mother, dear mother;"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The drowning pig cried,<br>
"I see all this comes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of my folly and pride!"<br>
He could not speak more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But he sank down and died,<br>
Whilst his mother and brothers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wept round the well-side!<br>

<p>
And round and round an oaken beam<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A hempen cord they flung,<br>
And like a mighty pendulum<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All solemnly he swung.<br>
<p>
Now say thy prayers, thou sinful man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And think what thou hast done,<br>
And read thy catechism well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou sanguinary one.<br>
<p>
For if its sprite should walk by night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It better were for thee,<br>
That thou were mouldering in the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or bleaching in the sea.<br>
<p>
It was the savage butcher then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That made a mock of sin,<br>
And swore a very wicked oath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not care a pin.<br>
<p>
It was the butcher's youngest son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice was broke with sighs,<br>
And with his pocket handkerchief<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He wiped his little eyes.<br>
<p>
All young and ignorant was he,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But innocent and mild,<br>
And, in his soft simplicity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out spoke the tender child&mdash;<br>
<p>
"Oh! father, father, list to me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pig is deadly sick,<br>
And men have hung him by his heels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fed him with a stick."<br>
<p>
It was the naughty butcher then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That laughed as he would die,<br>
Yet did he soothe the sorrowing child<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bid him not to cry.<br>
<p>
"Oh! Nathan, Nathan, what's a pig,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou shouldst weep and wail?<br>
Come bear thee like a butcher's child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou shalt have his tail."<br>
<p>
It was the butcher's daughter then,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So slender and so fair,<br>
That sobbed as if her heart would break<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And tore her yellow hair.<br>
<p>
And thus she spoke in thrilling tone&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fell fast the tear-drops big:<br>
"Ah! woe to me! Alas! alas!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pig! the pig! the pig!"<br>
<p>
Then did her wicked father's lips<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make merry wit her woe,<br>
And call her many a naughty name,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because she whimpered so.<br>
<p>
Ye need not weep, ye gentle ones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In vain your tears are shed,<br>
Ye cannot wash the crimson hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye cannot sooth the dead.<br>
<p>
The bright sun folded on his breast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His robes of rosey flame,<br>
And softly over all the west<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The shades of evening came.<br>
<p>
He slept, and troops of murdered pigs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were busy in his dreams;<br>
Loud rang their wild, unearthly shrieks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide yawned their mortal seams.<br>
<p>
The clock struck twelve; the dead hath heard;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He opened both his eyes,<br>
And sullenly he shook his tail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To lash the feeding flies.<br>
<p>
One quiver of the hempen cord&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One struggle and one bound&mdash;<br>
With stiffened limb and leaded eye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pig was on the ground.<br>
<p>
And straight towards the sleeper's house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His fearful way he wended;<br>
And hooting owl, and hovering bat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On midnight wing attended.<br>
<p>
Back flew the bolt, uprose the latch,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And open swung the door,<br>
And little mincing feet were heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pat, pat, along the floor.<br>
<p>
Two hoofs upon the sanded floor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And two upon the bed;<br>
And they are breathing side by side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The living and the dead.<br>
<p>
"Now wake, now wake, thou butcher man!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What makes your cheeks so pale?<br>
Take hold! take hold! thou dost not fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To clasp a spectre's tail?"<br>
<p>
Untwisted every winding coil;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The shuddering wretch took hold,<br>
Till like an icicle it seemed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So tapering and so cold.<br>
<p>
"Thou com'st with me, thou butcher man!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He strives to loose his grasp,<br>
But, faster than the clinging vine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Those twining spirals clasp.<br>
<p>
And open, open, swung the door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And fleeter than the wind,<br>
The shadowy spectre swept before,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The butcher trailed behind.<br>
<p>
Fast fled the darkness of the night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And morn rose faint and dim;<br>
They called full loud, they knocked full long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not waken him.<br>
<p>
Straight, straight towards that oaken beam,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A trampled pathway ran;<br>
A ghastly shape was swinging there&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the butcher man.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
Little Dame Crump,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With her little hair broom,<br>
One morning was sweeping<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her little bedroom,<br>
When, casting he little<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grey eyes on the ground,<br>
In a sly little corner<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A penny she found.<br>
<p>
"Dear me!" cried the Dame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While she started with surprise,<br>
"How lucky I am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To find such a prize!<br>
To market I'll go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a pig I will buy,<br>
And little John Grubbins<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall make him a sty."<br>
<p>
So she washed her face clean,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And put on her gown,<br>
And locked up the house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And set off for town.<br>
Then to market she went,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a purchase she made<br>
Of a little white pig,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a penny she paid.<br>
<p>
Having purchased the pig,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She was puzzled to know<br>
How they both should get home;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So fearing least piggie<br>
Should play her a trick,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She drove him along<br>
With a little crab stick.<br>
<p>
Piggie ran till they came<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the foot of a hill,<br>
Where a little bridge stood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the stream of a mill;<br>
Piggie grunted and squeaked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But not further would go:<br>
Oh, fie! Piggie, fie!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve little Dame so.<br>
<p>
She went to the mill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she borrowed a sack<br>
To put the pig in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And take him on her back:<br>
Piggie squeaked to get out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the little Dame said,<br>
"If you won't go of yourself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You then must be made."<br>
<p>
At last when the end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her journey had come,<br>
She was awfully glad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She had got the pig home:<br>
She carried him straight<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To his nice little sty,<br>
And gave him some hay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And some straw, nice and dry.<br>
<p>
With a handful of peas<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Piggie she fed,<br>
And put on her night-cap,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And got into bed:<br>
Having first said her prayers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And put out the light;<br>
And being quite tired,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll wish her  good night.<br>

<center><b>The Chinese Pig</b></center><br>
<p>
Old Madam Grumph, the pig, had got<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A pig-sty of her own;<br>
She is a most un-com-mon pig,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And likes to live alone.<br>
<p>
A red-tiled roofing covers in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The one half of her sty;<br>
And, half sur-round-ed by a wall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is open to the sky.<br>
<p>
There stands the trough, they keep it fill'd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With pig-wash and with parings;<br>
And all the other pigs declare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dame Grumph has dainty fairings.<br>
<p>
They like to see what she's about,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And poke their noses through<br>
A great hole in the pig-sty door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From whence they get a view.<br>
<p>
The pigs, that run about the yard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are very lean and tall,<br>
With long hind legs&mdash;but Madam Grumph<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is round as any ball.<br>
<p>
One autumn day, when she awoke<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;('Twas very cold and raw),<br>
She found a litter of young pigs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Half buried in the straw.<br>
<p>
"Humph," said the dame, "now let me see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How many have I got."<br>
She counted, "Six and four are ten,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Two dead ones in the lot.<br>
<p>
"Eight&mdash;That's a nice round family;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A black one and two white;<br>
The rest are spotted like myself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With prick ears&mdash;that's all right.<br>
<p>
"What's to be done with those dead things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd better be thrown out,"<br>
Said she, and packed the litter round<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The others with her snout.<br>
<p>
"What's that, old Grumphy?" said a pig,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose snout peeped through the door;<br>
"There's something moving in the straw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I never saw before."<br>
<p>
"I wish you'd mind your own affairs,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said she, and stepp'd between<br>
The young pigs and the pig-sty door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not wishing to be seen.<br>
<p>
"I hope you slept well," said the pig,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"The wind was very high;<br>
You are most comfortably lodged&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A most con-ve-ni-ent sty."<br>
<p>
"I thought I told you once before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To mind your own affairs,"<br>
Said she, and bristling up her back,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She bit the lean pig's ears.<br>
<p>
"Squeak," said the bitten pig, "sque-e-ak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Grumphy's biting hard;"<br>
And all the lean pigs scamp-ed'd up<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From all sides of the yard.<br>
<p>
They grumbled and they grunted loud,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The squeak'd in every key;<br>
At last another pig peep'd through,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see what he could see.<br>
<p>
Dame Grumph was standing by her pigs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And looking very proud,<br>
And all the little piggy-wigs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were squeaking very loud.<br>
<p>
"These lovely creatures," said old Grumph,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"These lovely pigs are mine;<br>
There're fat and pink like human babes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Most pro-mi-sing young swine."<br>
<p>
"Indeed," ex-claim'd the peeping pig,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"I never should have thought,<br>
They were so very promising."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Old Grumphy gave a snort.<br>
<p>
"They're of a most dis-tin-guished race;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother and her brother<br>
Were both im-por-ted from Pekin,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My pigs are like my mother.<br>
<p>
"They never shall as-so-ci-ate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With long-legged pigs like you."<br>
Said she, ad-dress-ing the lean pig,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose snout was peeping through.<br>
<p>
"Begging your pardon, ma'am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I really think," said he,<br>
"The dif-fer-ence is not so great<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As it appears to be.<br>
<p>
"If you and I were bacon, ma'am<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The dif-fer-ence between<br>
An Irish and a Chinese pig<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would hardly then be seen.<br>
<p>
"Give me your comfortable sty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And some of your nice food,<br>
Our little fa-mi-lies might prove<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In-dif-fer-ent-ly good."<br>

covered
the bottom with pebbles, and then filled the bucket with
water,

gave her
a wisp of hay.<br>
<p>
As soon as the cow had eaten the hay, she gave the old woman the
milk; and away she went with it in a saucer to the cat. As soon as
the cat had drank the milk, the cat began to kill the rat, the rat
began to gnaw the rope, the rope began to hang the butcher, the
butcher began to kill the ox, the ox began to drink the water, the
water began to quench the fire, the fire began to burn the stick,
the stick began to beat the dog, the dog began to bite to pig, the
pig in a great fright jumped over the stile, and so the old woman
got home that night in time to boil some apple dumplings for her
husband's supper.

<center><b>The Story of the Three Little Pigs</b></center><br>
<p>
Once there was an old pig, who had three little pigs, and sent them
out to seek their fortune. The first one went and built a house with
straw, and soon after a wolf came and knocked at the door and said,
"Little pig, let me come in." But the little pig said, "No, no by the
hair of my chin." The wolf then said, "I'll huff, and I'll puff, and
I'll blow your house in." So he huffed, and he puffed, and blew the
house in, and ate up the little pig.
<p>
The next little pig built a house with sticks, and the old wolf came
along and called out, "Little pig, let me come in." And the little
pig answered, "No, no, by the hair of my chin." "Then," says the
wolf, "I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in." So he
huffed and he puffed, and blew the house down, and ate up the little
pig also.
<p>
The third little pig built a house with bricks. Just after along came
the old wolf, and said, "Little pig, let me come in." The little pig
said, "No, no, by the hair of my chin." "Then I'll huff and I'll
puff, and I'll blow your house down." Well, he huffed and he puffed,
and he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed; but he
could not get the house down.
<p>
When he found he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow
the house down, he said "Little pig, I know where there is a nice
field of turnips." "Where?" said the little pig. "Oh, in Mr. Smith's
home field, and if you will be ready to-morrow morning I will call
for you, and we will go together, and get some for dinner."
<p>
"Very well," said the little pig, "I will be ready. What time do you
mean to go?" "Oh, at six o'clock." Well, the little pig got up at
five, and got the turnips before the wolf came, which he did about
six, and said, "Little pig, are you ready?" The little pig said,
"Ready; I've been and come back again and got a nice potful for
dinner."
<p>
The wolf felt very angry at this, but thought that he would be up to
the little pig somehow or other, so he said, "Little pig, I know
where there is a nice apple tree." "Where?" said the little pig.
"Down at Merry Garden," replied the wolf, "and if you will not
deceive me I will come for you at five o'clock to-morrow, and we will
go together and get some apples."
<p>
Well, the pig bustled up the next morning at four o'clock, and went
off for the apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but he
had further to go, and had to climb the tree, so that just as he was
coming down from it he saw the wolf coming, which, as you may
suppose, frightened him very much. When the wolf came up he said,
"Little pig, what; are you here before me? Are they nice apples?"
<p>
"Yes, very," said the little pig, "I will throw you down one." And he
threw it so far that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the
little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came
again, and said "Little pig, there is a fair at Shanklin this
afternoon, will you go?" Oh, yes," said the pig, "I will go: what
time shall you be ready?" "At three," said the wolf.
<p>
So the little pig went off before the time as usual, got to the fair,
and bought a butter-churn, which he was going home with, when he saw
the wolf coming. Then he could not tell what to do. So he got into
the churn to hide, and by doing so turned it around, and it rolled
down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much
that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little
pig's house and told him how frightened he had been by a great round
thing which came down the hill past him.
<p>
Then the little pig said "Ha! I frightened you, then. I had been to
the fair and bought a butter-churn, and when I saw you I got into it
and rolled down the hill." Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and
declared he would eat up the little pig, and that he would get down
the chimney after him.
<p>
When the little pig saw what he was about, he hung onto the pot full
of water, and made up a blazing fire, and just as the wolf was coming
down, took off the cover, and in fell the wolf; so the little pig put
on the cover again in an instant, boiled him up, and ate him for
supper, and lived happy ever afterwards.

<p>
Among the sand-hills,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Near by the sea,<br>
Wild young rabbits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were seen by me.<br>
<p>
They live in burrows<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With winding-ways,<br>
And there they shelter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On rainy days.<br>
<p>
The mother rabbits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make cosy nests,<br>
With hairy linings<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From their breasts.<br>
<p>
The tender young ones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are nursed and fed,<br>
And safely hidden<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this warm bed.<br>
<p>
And when they are older,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They all come out<br>
Upon the sand-hills<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And frisk about.<br>
<p>
They play and nibble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The long, dry grass,<br>
But scamper away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever you pass.<br>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pert little rabbit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Once lived in a hole,<br>
And just did whatever he pleased;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ways were so funny,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;His antics so droll,<br>
That his parents were terribly teased.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now, dear," said his mother,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;"You'd best stay at home,<br>
And try to be patient and good."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But No! he was fully<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Determined to roam<br>
Through the green and beautiful wood.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what did he do?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;On a fine summer day,<br>
When mother was not to be seen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took to his heels,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And scampered away<br>
Right over the meadow so green.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his long ears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;And he whisked up his tail,<br>
His eyes dancing with glee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As onward he ran<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Through a beautiful vale,<br>
And oh! how delighted was he!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Twas not very long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Till he found a haystack,<br>
Where of course there was shelter and food.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he to himself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;"Now, I'll never go back<br>
To my stupid old home in the wood.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'll dig myself a nice den<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;For myself in the hay;<br>
How warm it will be and how nice!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why in my old burrow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full many a day<br>
I've often felt colder than ice!"<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So bunny soon dug him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;A nice little hole,<br>
And made it as round as an O;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And really he looked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;So exceedingly droll,<br>
You'd have laughed had you seen him, I know.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But evening drew on,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;It was lonely and dark,<br>
So Bunny lay down in his den;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he to himself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;"I'll get up with the lark,<br>
And won't I be ravenous then!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For really this hay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Though it does for a nest,<br>
Is somewhat too dry for my food;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At home there is clover,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;The thing I love best,<br>
And lettuce and carrots so good.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I wish I had some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;At this moment! but then<br>
I'm out on my travels just now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I greatly prefer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;To reside in this den,<br>
Than at home where there's often a row!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah, well! I feel sleepy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;I'd best go to bed&mdash;<br>
But what is that noise that I hear?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be someone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Right over my head,<br>
I hope that no wild beasts are near!"<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile an old fox<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;With a great bushy tail<br>
Was prowling about and around,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But poor little Bunny<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was hidden so well<br>
That never a bit was he found!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When morning had come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;And the fox disappeared,<br>
Then Bunny came forth to the light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he to himself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;"It was just as I feared,<br>
A fox has been here through the night.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I think I had better<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go scampering home<br>
To the dear little home in the wood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never, oh never<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again will I roam,<br>
Or leave my dear mother so good."<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away then he ran,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Without once looking back,<br>
Till he saw the dear home he loved best.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mother came hopping<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Along the hard track<br>
To welcome him home to the nest.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, oh! such a breakfast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;Before him there lay,<br>
Such clover and grass from the wood;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And always I've heard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;From that terrible day,<br>
That Bunny is patient and good.<br>

<center><b>The Pet Rabbit</b></center><br>
<p>
I have a little Bunny<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With his coat as soft as down,<br>
And nearly all of him is white<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Except one bit of brown.<br>
The first thing in the morning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When I get out of bed,<br>
I wonder if my bunny's still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe in his shed.<br>
<p>
And then the next thing that I do,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I daresay you have guessed;<br>
It's at once to go and see him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am washed and dressed.<br>
And every day I see him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I like him more and more,<br>
And each day he is bigger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than he was the day before.<br>
<p>
I feed him in the morning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With bran and bits of bread.<br>
And every night I take some straw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make his little bed.<br>
What with carrots in the morning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And turnip-tops for tea,<br>
If a bunny can be happy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sure he ought to be.<br>
<p>
Then when it's nearly bed-time<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I go down to his shed,<br>
And say "Good-night, you bunny!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I go to bed,<br>
I think there's only one thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That would make me happy quite,<br>
If I could take my bunny dear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With me to bed at night.<br>

<p>
Beyond the palings of the park<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A Hare had made her form,<br>
Beneath a drooping fern, that made<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A shelter snug and warm.<br>
<p>
She slept until the daylight came,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all thinks were awake,<br>
And then the Hare, with noiseless steps,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Crept softly from the brake.<br>
<p>
She stroked her whiskers with her paws,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looked timidly around<br>
With open eyes and ears erect<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That caught the smallest sound.<br>
<p>
The Field-Mouse rustled in the grass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Squirrel in the trees,<br>
But Puss was not at all afraid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of common sounds like these.<br>
<p>
She frisked and gambolled with delight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And cropped a leaf or two<br>
Of clover and of tender grass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That glistened in the dew.<br>
<p>
What was it, then, that made her start,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And run away so fast?<br>
She heard the distant sound of hounds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She heard the huntsman's blast.<br>
<p>
Tally-ho!-hoy tally-ho!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hounds are in full cry;<br>
Ehew! ehew&mdash;in scarlet coats<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The men are sweeping by.<br>
<p>
So off she set with a spring and a bound,<br>
Over the meadows and open ground,<br>
Faster than hunter and faster than hound<br>
And on&mdash;and on&mdash;till she lost the sound,<br>
And away went the little Hare.<br>

<p>
Here lies whom hound did ne'er pursue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor swifter greyhound follow,<br>
Whose foot ne'er tainted morning dew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor ear heard huntsman's halloo.<br>
<p>
Old Tiney, surliest of his kind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who, nursed with tender care,<br>
And to domestic bounds confined,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was still a wild Jack-hare.<br>
<p>
Though duly from my hand he took<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His pittance every night,<br>
He did it with a jealous look,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when he could he would bite.<br>
<p>
On twigs of hawthorn he regaled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On pippin's russet peel;<br>
And when his juicy salads fail'd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sliced carrot pleased him well.<br>
<p>
A Turkey carpet was his lawn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereon he loved to bound,<br>
To skip and gambol like a fawn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And swing himself around.<br>
<p>
His frisking was at evening hours<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For then he'd lost his fear!<br>
But most before approaching showers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or when a storm drew near.<br>
<p>
Eight years and five round-rolling moons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He thus saw steal away,<br>
Dozing out all his idle noons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every night at play.<br>
<p>
I kept him for his humour's sake,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he would oft beguile<br>
My heart of thoughts that made it ache,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And force me to a smile.<br>
<p>
But now, beneath this walnut shade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He finds his long last home,<br>
And waits, in snug concealment laid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till gentler puss shall come.<br>
<p>
He, still more aged, feels the shocks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From which no care can save;<br>
And partner once of Tiney's box,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Must soon partake his grave.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Hamelin Town's in Brunswick<br>
By famous Hanover city;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The river Weser, deep and wide,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Washes its wall on the southern side.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasanter spot you never spied;<br>
But, when begins my ditty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost five hundred years ago,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see the townsfolk suffer so<br>
From vermin was a pity.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rats!<br>
They fought the dogs and killed the cats,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And bit the babies in the cradles,<br>
And ate the cheeses out of the vats,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And licked the soup from the cook's own
ladles,<br>
Split open the kegs of salted sprats,<br>
Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,<br>
And even spoiled the women's chats,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By drowning their speaking,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With shrieking and squeaking<br>
In fifty different sharps and flats.<br>
<p>
At last the people in a body<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Town Hall came flocking:<br>
"'Tis clear," cried they, "our Mayor's a noddy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as for our Corporation&mdash;shocking<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling first a little smile,<br>
As if he knew what magic slept<br>

Then, like a musical adept,<br>
To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled,<br>

Like a candle flame where salt is sprinkled;<br>
And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,<br>
You heard as if an army muttered;<br>
And the muttering grew to a grumbling;<br>
And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.<br>

Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,<br>
Brown rats, black rats, grey rats, tawny rats,<br>

Blow your pipe there till you burst!"<br>
Once more he stept into the street:<br>
And to his lips again<br>
Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;<br>
And ere he blew three notes (such sweet<br>
Soft notes as yet musicians cunning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never gave the enraptured air),<br>
There was a rustling, that seemed like a bustling<br>
Of merry crowds pustling, at pitching and hustling,<br>
Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,<br>
Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering,<br>
And like fowls in a farmyard when barley is
scattering,<br>
Out came the children running,<br>
All the little boys and girls,<br>
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,<br>
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,<br>
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after<br>
The wonderful music with shouting laughter.<br>
<p>
The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood<br>
As if they were carved into blocks of wood,<br>
Unable to move a step, or cry<br>
To the children merrily skipping by&mdash;<br>
And could only follow with the eye<br>
That joyous crowd at the Piper's back.<br>
But how the Mayor was on the rack,<br>
And the wretched Council's bosoms beat,<br>
As the Piper turned from the High street<br>
To where the Weser rolled its waters<br>
Right in the way of their sons and daughters!<br>
However he turned from South to West,<br>
And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,<br>
And after him the children pressed;<br>
Great was the joy in every breast.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"He never can cross that mighty top!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He's forced to let the piping drop,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we shall see out children stop!"<br>
When lo! as they reached the mountain's side,<br>
A wondrous portal opened wide,<br>
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed<br>
And the Piper advanced and the children followed.<br>
And when all were in to the very last,<br>
The door in the mountain-side shut fast,<br>
Did I say all? No! one was lame,<br>
And could not dance the whole of the way!<br>
<p>
And in after years, if you would blame<br>
His sadness, he was used to say&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's dull in our town since my playmates
left;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't forget that I'm bereft<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all they pleasant sights they see,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which the Piper also promised me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For he led us, he said, to a joyous land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Joining the town and just at hand,<br>
Where waters gushed and fruit trees grew,<br>
And flowers put forth a fairer hue.<br>

<center><b>The Wicked Bishop Hatto</b></center><br>
<p>
The summer and autumn had been so wet<br>
That in winter the corn was growing yet;<br>
'Twas a piteous sight to see all around<br>
The grain lie rotting on the ground.<br>
<p>
Every day the starving poor<br>
Crowded around Bishop Hatto's door,<br>
For all the neighbourhood could tell<br>
His granaries were furnished well.<br>
<p>
At last Bishop Hatto appointed a day<br>
To quiet the poor without delay:<br>
He bade them to his great Barn repair<br>
And they should have food for the winter there.<br>
<p>
Rejoiced such tidings good to hear,<br>
The poor folk flocked from far and near;<br>
So the great Barn was full as it could hold<br>
Of women and children, and young and old.<br>
<p>
Then when he saw it could hold no more,<br>
Bishop Hatto he made fast the door;<br>
And while for mercy with shrieks they call,<br>
He set fire to the Barn and burnt them all,<br>
<p>
"A rare and excellent bonfire!" quoth he,<br>
"And the country is greatly obliged to me,<br>
For ridding it in these times forlorn<br>
Of Rats that only consume the corn."<br>
<p>
So then to his palace returned he,<br>
And he sat down to supper merrily,<br>
And he slept that night like an innocent man;&mdash;<br>
But Bishop Hatto never slept again.<br>
<p>
In the morning as he entered the hall,<br>
Where his picture hung against the wall,<br>
A sweat like death all over him came,<br>
For the Rats had eaten it out of the frame.<br>
<p>
As he looked, there came a man from his farm,<br>
He had a countenance white with alarm;&mdash;<br>
"I opened your granaries this morn,<br>
And the Rats had eaten all the corn."<br>
<p>
Another came running presently,<br>
And he was pale as pale could be;&mdash;<br>
"Fly! my Lord Bishop, without delay,<br>
Ten thousand rats are coming this way."<br>
<p>
"I'll go to my tower on the Rhine," quoth he,<br>
"'Tis the safest place in Germany;<br>
The walls are high and the shores are steep,<br>
And the stream is long and the water deep."<br>
<p>
Bishop Hatto fearfully hastened away,<br>
And he crossed the Rhine without delay,<br>
And reached his tower, and barred with care<br>
All the windows, doors, and loopholes there.<br>
<p>
He laid him down, and closed his eyes.<br>
But soon a scream made him arise:<br>
He started, and saw two eyes of flame<br>
On his pillow, from whence the screaming came.<br>
<p>
He listened, and looked&mdash;it was only the cat;<br>
But the Bishop grew more fearful for that,<br>
For she sat screaming, mad with fear,<br>
At the army of rats that were drawing near.<br>
<p>
For they have swum over the river so deep,<br>
And they have climed the shores so steep,<br>
And up the tower their way is bent,<br>
To do the work for which they were sent.<br>
<p>
They are not to be told by the dozen or score&mdash;<br>
By the thousands they come, and by myriads, and more;<br>
Such numbers have never been heard of before,<br>
Such a judgement had never been witnessed of yore.<br>
<p>
Down on his knees the Bishop fell,<br>
And faster and faster his beads did tell,<br>
As louder and louder, drawing near,<br>
The gnawing by their teeth he could hear.<br>
<p>
And in at the windows, and in at the door,<br>
And through the walls helter-skelter they pour,<br>
And down from the ceiling, and up from the floor,<br>
From the right and the left, from behind and before,<br>
From within and without, from above and below;<br>
And all at once to the Bishop they go.<br>
<p>
They have whetted their teeth against the stones,<br>
And now they pick the Bishop's bones;<br>
They gnawed the flesh from every limb,<br>
For they were sent to do judgement on him.<br>

<p>
A baby-girl, on Christmas night<br>
Had filled her little apron white<br>
With all a happy child could take<br>
Of Christmas toys and Christmas cake;<br>
<p>
But on the stairway she let fall<br>
The chiefest treasure of them all&mdash;<br>
A little cat of gingerbread<br>
All frosted white from tail to head.<br>
<p>
Now in the moonlit midnight time,<br>
When merry mice do run and climb,<br>
A plump gray mouse come down the stair<br>
And saw the Christmas cake-cat there.<br>
<p>
She stood still in her cruel fright<br>
And gazed upon the monster white<br>
Who seemed to feel as great surprise,<br>
And stared with both his raisin eyes.<br>
<p>
Poor mousie dared not, could not stir!<br>
Her little brain was in a whirr!<br>
Five minutes&mdash;ten&mdash;but not a paw<br>
Had puss put forth! "I never saw<br>
<p>
A cat like this!" the poor mouse said.<br>
A brave bold thought came in her head&mdash;<br>
Her wee heart beating pit-a-pat,<br>
She moved her own paw&mdash;touched the cat&mdash;<br>
<p>
Then sprang upon it with a squeal<br>
And made a most delicious meal<br>
"Ho! ho!" she cried, "Sugar! spice!<br>
And everything that's good and nice&mdash;<br>
<p>
That's what cats are made of,<br>
The cats that we're afraid of!"<br>
Then up the stairs she madly pranced,<br>
And o'er the attic floor she danced<br>
<p>
And then she stood upon her head<br>
And to her 'stonished friends she said,<br>
"O, joy to every mouse and rat,<br>
For I have eaten up the cat!"<br>

But forcing one through<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such rough crannies as these,<br>
Always gives one's poor ribs<br>

"But the best of all is,<br>

A large piece of cheese,<br>

"Ah, child," said the mother,<br>

Both the cage and the cheese<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are a terrible cheat;<br>
Do not think all that trouble<br>

They would catch us and kill us<br>

One Summer day the sun shone bright,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mid sweet flowers roved the bee,<br>
And I wandered in a garden old<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the deep blue sea.<br>
<p>
But close at hand, a shady path,<br>

And there. that sultry summer day,<br>

&nbsp;What strange sight did I see!<br>
A little mouse, and in her mouth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Another still more wee.<br>

Softly she crept across the path,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, her journey done,<br>
In a hole beneath the green grass verge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She laid her little one.<br>
<p>
And back and forth from side to side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I watched her carry five<br>
Sweet little mice, her own dear brood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Long tailed, and all alive.<br>
<p>
She never wearied in her work,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet oh! so small was she!<br>
And thus, that bright, hot summer day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She moved her nursery.<br>

&nbsp;And set them alight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, before the poor mouse<br>

&nbsp;Could run off in its fright,<br>
It was smother'd to death in the heat!<br>

<center><b>The Foolish Frog</b></center><br>
<p>
In a tank at the foot of the hill<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lived Mr. and Mrs. Frog,<br>
At the head of the sparkling rill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the side of a queachy bog;<br>
And they had children ten&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All froggies as yellow as gold,<br>
Who loved to play on the fen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But they often were over-bold.<br>
<p>
Now it fell out one bright day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As it never had done before,<br>
When Father Frog was away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A stickleback sailed to the door.<br>
"Oh! Mrs. Frog," said he,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your sister is very ill;<br>
And much she wants to see<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You down at the water mill."<br>
<p>
Then Mother frog showed her grief<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In such tears as you never saw;<br>
And, having no handkerchief,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She wiped her eyes with a paw.<br>
Said she, "Now, froggies dear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You must not go to the fen:<br>
There is no danger here,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And I'll soon come back again!"<br>
<p>
But the naughty little froggies,<br>
Disobeyed their mother and went.<br>
<p>
Then a duck, which had lazily swum<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For hours in a reedy pool,<br>
Seeing the shadows come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And feeling the air grow cool.<br>
With a "Quack, quack, quack," came out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She meant, "It is time to sup!"<br>
So finding the froggies about,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She gobbled them quickly up.<br>
<p>
So Mr. and Mrs. Frog,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the peeping stars made bold,<br>
Came back by the queachy bog,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To their froggies all yellow as gold.<br>
They never saw them again&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas! that it should be so.<br>
They were told not to go to the fen;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the did not obey, you know.<br>

<center><b>Marriage of Mr. Froggie</b></center><br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a Frog<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lived in a bog&mdash;<br>
A Frog of high degree&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stylish youth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, forsooth,<br>
A bachelor was he.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had not wed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, he said,<br>
He'd ne'er in all his life<br>

He cared to make his wife.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one fine day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When drest up gay,<br>
He passed a pretty house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there beside<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The window spied<br>
A most attractive mouse.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He raised his hat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gazing at<br>
Miss Mouse, in suit of gray,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made a bow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Likewise a vow<br>
To marry her straightway.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he was drest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In scarlet vest,<br>
And coat of velvet sheen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With frills of lace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sword in place,<br>
His like was nowhere seen.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His smile was bland,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His style so grand,<br>
He said with pride, "I know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Mouse so fair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can find nowhere<br>
So suitable a beau!<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If she'll agree<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To live with me,<br>
And be my faithful wife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, she shall dine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On dishes fine,<br>
And lead an easy life."<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went by,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Mouse so shy,<br>
Would hide her blushing face;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But truth to tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could see quite well<br>
Through curtains of thin lace.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from her nook,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! many a look<br>
She gave, with heart a-stir;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oft did she<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confess that he<br>
Was just the beau for her.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last so blue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor froggie grew,<br>
He went up to the house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rang the bell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In haste to tell<br>
His love for Mistress Mouse.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He passed the door,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the floor<br>
He knelt and kissed her hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Wilt marry me?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked, while she<br>
Her burning blushes fanned.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She answered "Yes,"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you may guess,<br>
To Mister Frog's delight;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His arm he placed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around her waist,<br>
And joy was at its height.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wedding-day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was set straightway,<br>
The town was all agog;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gifts, not few,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were sent unto<br>
Miss Mouse and Mister Frog.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was banquet set,<br>
In country or in town,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With fare more rich<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than that to which<br>
The wedding guests sat down.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, after all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the ball,<br>
For which the band was hired,<br>

<center><b>Mouse that Lost her Tail</b></center><br>
<p>
Once upon a time a Cat and Mouse were playing together, when, quite
by accident, the cat bit off the Mouse's tail.
<p>
It was very strange that the Cat did not bite off the Mouse's head.
But this Mouse was a good Mouse, and never stole any cheese; and so
the Cat only bit off her tail. Mousey was very much vexed to see that
her tail was gone, so she said to Pussy&mdash;
<p>
"Oh, dear Pussy! do give me my tail again."<br>
"No, that I will not," said Pussy, "till you get me some
milk for my breakfast."<br>
"Oh, the Cow will give me some," said the Mouse.<br>
<p>
So she frisked and jumped, and then she ran<br>
Till she came to the Cow, and thus began:&mdash;<br>
<p>
"Please, Cow, give me some milk. I want to give Pussy
milk, and Pussy will give me my own tail again."<br>
"So I will, Mousey, if you will get me some hay for my
breakfast." said the Cow.<br>
"Oh, the Farmer will give me some," said the Mouse.<br>
<p>
So she frisked and jumped, and then she ran<br>
Till she came to the Farmer, and thus began:&mdash;<br>
<p>
"Please, Mr. Farmer, give me some hay; I want to give the
Cow hay The Cow will give me some milk; I will give Pussy milk;
and Pussy will give me my own tail again."<br>
"So I will, Mousey, if you get me some bread for my
breakfast," said the Farmer.<br>
"Oh, the Baker will give me some," said the Mouse.<br>
<p>
So she frisked and jumped, and then she ran<br>
Till she came to the Baker, and thus began:&mdash;<br>
<p>
"Please, Mr. Baker, give me some bread; I want to give
the Farmer bread. The Farmer will give me some hay; I will give the
Cow hay, the Cow will give me some milk; I will give Pussy milk;
and Pussy will give me my own tail again."<br>
"So I will, Mousey, if you get me some meat for my
breakfast," said the baker.<br>
"Oh, the Butcher will give me some," said the Mouse.<br>
<p>
So she frisked and jumped, and then she ran<br>
Till she came to the Butcher, and thus began:&mdash;<br>
<p>
"Please, Mr. Butcher, give me some meat. I want to give
the Baker meat. The Baker will give me some bread; I will give the
Farmer bread. The Farmer will give me some hay; I will give the
Cow hay, the Cow will give me some milk; I will give Pussy milk;
and Pussy will give me my own tail again."<br>
"So I will, Mousey, if you will eat up the crumbs that
have fallen at my breakfast," said the Butcher.<br>
"Oh, that I will," said the Mouse, and she soon cleared
the floor of every crumb.<br>
<p>
Then the Butcher gave the Mouse some meat, and the Mouse
gave the Baker the meat, and the Baker gave the Mouse some bread,
and the Mouse gave the Farmer the bread, and the Farmer gave the
Mouse some hay, and the Mouse gave the Cow the hay, and the
Cow gave the Mouse some milk, and the Mouse gave Pussy the
milk, and then Pussy gave poor little Mousey her own tail again.
<br>
<p>
So she frisked and jumped, and away she ran<br>
And cried out to Pussy, "Catch me if you can!"<br>

In a crack near the cupboard, with dainties provided,<br>

Any mouse in the land might have envied their lot.<br>
<p>
But one day the young mouse, which was given to roam,<br>
Having made an excursion some way from her home,<br>
On a sudden returned, with such joy in her eyes,<br>
That her grey, sedate parent expressed some surprise.<br>
<p>
"O mother," said she, "The good folks of this house,<br>
I'm convinced, have not any ill-will to a mouse;<br>
And those tales can't be true you always are telling,<br>
For they've been at such pains to construct us a
dwelling.<br>
<p>
"The floor is of wood, and the walls are of wires,<br>
Exactly the size that one's comfort requires;<br>
And I'm sure that we there shall have nothing to fear,<br>
If ten cats, with kittens, at once should appear.<br>
<p>
"And then they have made such nice holes in the wall,<br>
One could slip in and out, with no trouble at all;<br>
But forcing one through such rough crannies as these,<br>
Always gives one's poor ribs a most terrible squeeze.<br>
<p>
"But the best of all is, they've provided, as well,<br>
A large piece of cheese, of most exquisite smell;<br>
'T was so nice, I had put in my head to go through,<br>
When I thought it my duty to come and fetch you."<br>
<p>
"Ah, child," said the mother, "believe, I entreat,<br>
Both the cage and the cheese are a terrible cheat;<br>
Do not think all that trouble they took for our good,<br>
They would catch us and kill us there if they could.<br>
<p>
"Thus they've caught and killed scores, and I never could
learn,<br>
That a mouse who once entered did ever return."<br>
Let young people mind what the old people say,<br>
And, when danger is near them keep out of the way.<br>

What a tyrant is this to spill innocent blood!"<br>

Well, onward they marched, and they moralised still.<br>
Till they came where some poultry picked chaff by a
mill.<br>

"The wind, I believe, ma'am, is south:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A fine harvest for peas;"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He then looked at the cheese,<br>
But the crow did not open her mouth.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sly Reynard, not tired,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He plumage admired:<br>
"How charming! how brilliant its hue!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The voice must be fine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a bird so divine,<br>
Ah, let me hear it, pray do.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe me I long<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear a sweet song;"<br>
The silly crow foolishly tries;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She scarce gave one squall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the cheese she let fall,<br>
And the fox ran away with the prize.<br>

<center><b>The Blind Men and the Elephant<br></b>
(A Hindoo Fable)</center>
<p>
It was six men of Indostan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To learning much inclined,<br>
Who went to see an elephant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Though all of them were blind),<br>
That each by observation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Might satisfy his mind.<br>
<p>
The FIRST approached the Elephant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And happening to fall<br>
Against his broad and sturdy side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At once began to bawl:<br>
"God bless me!&mdash;but the Elephant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is very like a wall!"<br>
<p>
The SECOND feeling of the tusk,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cried: "Ho! what have we here<br>
So very round and smooth and sharp!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To me 'tis mighty clear<br>
This wonder of an Elephant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is very like a spear!"<br>
<p>
The THIRD approached the animal,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And happening to take<br>
The squirming trunk within his hands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This boldly up and spake:<br>
"I see," quoth he, "The Elephant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is very like a snake!"<br>
<p>
The FOURTH reached out his eager hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt about the knee,<br>
"What most this wondrous beast is like<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is mighty plain," quoth he;<br>
"'Tis clear enough the Elephant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is very like a tree!"<br>
<p>
The FIFTH, who chanced to touch the ear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Said: "E'n the blindest man<br>
Can tell what this resembles most,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deny the fact who can,<br>
This marvel of an Elephant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is very like a fan."<br>
<p>
The SIXTH no sooner had begun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About the beast to grope,<br>
Than, seizing on the swinging tail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That fell within his scope,<br>
"I see," quoth he, "the Elephant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is very like a rope!"<br>
<p>
And so these men of Indostan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Disputed loud and long,<br>
Each in his own opinion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Exceeding stiff and strong,<br>
Though each was partly in the right,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all were in the wrong.<br>

A Nightingale, that all day long<br>
Had cheered the village with his song,<br>
Nor yet at eve his note suspended,<br>
Nor yet when eventide was ended,<br>
Began to feel&mdash;as well he might&mdash;<br>
The keen demands of appetite;<br>
When looking eagerly around,<br>
He spied, far off, upon the ground,<br>
A something shining in the dark,<br>
And knew the glow-worm by his spark;<br>
So; stooping down, from hawthorn top,<br>
He thought to put him in his crop<br>
The worm, aware of his intent,<br>
Harangued him this, quite eloquent&mdash;<br>
"Did you admire my lamp," quoth he,<br>
"As much as I your minstrelsy?<br>
You would abhor to do me wrong,<br>
As much as I to spoil your song;<br>
For 'twas the self-same power divine<br>
Taught you to sing, and me to shine:<br>
That you with music, I with light,<br>
Might beautify and cheer the night."<br>
The songster heard his short oration,<br>
And, warbling out his approbation,<br>
Released him as my story tells,<br>
And found a supper somewhere else.<br>

<p>
"The physician tells us of the physical benefits of laughing. There
is not the remotest corner or little inlet of the minute
blood-vessels of the human body that does not feel some wavelet from
the convulsion occasioned by good hearty laughter. The life
principle, or the central man, is shaken to the innermost depths,
sending new tided of life and strength to the surface, thus
materially tending to insure good health to persons who indulge
therein. The blood moves more rapidly, and conveys a different
impression to all the organs of the body, as it visits them on that
particular mystic journey when the man is laughing, from what it does
at other times. For this reason every good, hearty laugh in which a
person indulges lengthens his life, conveying as it does a new and
distinct stimulus to the vital forces."

<p>
Dear Sir&mdash;Many years ago it was my misfortune to be jilted in
love
by a cruel-hearted woman. I pined away, and fell into a bad state of
health, and was advised by my friends to take some physic. I never
took a single dose except somebody told me that it was exactly what
I wanted to make me well&mdash;but it all did me no good. I only got
worse until I came across the right thing, which I will presently
describe. I find, in looking over my paid bills, the following are
the kinds and quantities of physic I have used during my
illness:&mdash;
Holloway's Pills, 227 boxes; Cockle's Pills, 121 boxes, Beecham's
Pills, 80 boxes; Parr's Life Pills, 76 boxes, Blue Pills, 849 boxes.
One friend advised me to give up Pills and take some good
old-fashioned physic. I took of Jalap, 37 pounds; Caster Oil; 180
bottles, Salts and Senna, 800 doses; Rhubarb and Magnesia, 300 doses;
Brimstone and Treacle, 800 doses&mdash;but this did me no good.
Another
friend advised me to take some world-fames patent medicines, so I
took of Eno's Fruit Salt 190 bottles, Warner's Safe Cure, 200
bottles; Townsend's Sarsaparilla, 120 bottles; Hop Bitters, 180
bottles; Dandelion Ale, two hogsheads. I took Hayter's Nerve Tonic,
Hayter's Blood purifier, Hayter's Invigorator, and Hayter's
Pick-Me-Up, of each 100 bottles; and Wolfe's Schnapps, 630
bottles&mdash;
but I felt no better. Another friend came along, and said for my
complaint it was no use taking medicines internally, and I must use
the "Rub On Remedies," so I rubbed on Holloway's Ointment, 241 boxes;
Davis's Pain Killer, 70 bottles; Moulton's Pain Paint, 60 bottles;
St. Jacob's oil, Weston's Wizard Oil, and Croton Oil, of each 100
bottles: and of Eucalyptus Oil, 900 quart bottles&mdash;but I felt no
better. Another friend advised the Herb Cure, so I took strong
decoctions of Chamomile, Pennyroyal, Peppermint, Rue, Tansy, Quassia,
Horehound, Wormwood, Aconite, Belladonna, Hemlock, Nux Vomica,
Lungwort, Liverwort, Moonwort, Sneezewort, and
Snakeweed&mdash;altogether
I took about 1700 quarts of these horrid decoctions&mdash;but I felt
no
better. Another friend told me my stomach was out of order, and
required cleansing, so I took of Ipecacuanha Wine 139 quarts&mdash;but
this did not cure me. Another friend said all diseases come from
insects, and I had insects in me, and must take special medicine for
them, so I took of Keating's insecticide 730 packets&mdash;but got no
better. Another friend advised me to try Homoeopathy. I took 111
tubes of pilules and 80 bottles of tinctures&mdash;but they did me no
good. Another friend advised me to try the water cure. I took cold
baths, warm baths, tepid baths, and Turkish baths in hundreds, and
drank about twenty hogsheads of mineral waters&mdash;but it did me no
good. Another friend advised the Acid Cure, so I took Acetic Acid,
Muriatic Acid, Nitric Acid, Sulphuric Acid, Oxalic Acid, and Prussic
Acid, of each about twenty quarts&mdash;but got no better. Another
friend
advised Soothing Medicines, so I took over 400 of Steedman's Soothing
powders, and 130 bottles of Mother Winslow's Soothing Syrup&mdash;but
I
was still irritable and nervous. My last course of medicine consisted
of Steel Drops, Balm of Gilead, Turpentine, Chloroform, Cod Liver
Oil, Assafoetida, Spanish Flies, and Cayenne Pepper&mdash;about
fifteen
pounds of each&mdash;but it all did me no good. I simply got worse and
worse, and was reduced to a mere shadow of skin and bone, but, as
luck would have it, another friend came along&mdash;a true friend this
time&mdash;and suggested Cole's FUN DOCTOR. I got it, and was well and
stout in a Week, at a cost of 1s 6d.

A man on a train was heard to groan so frightfully that the
passengers took pity on him, and one of them gave him a drink out of
a whisky flask. "Do you feel better?" asked the giver. "I do," said
he who had groaned. "What ailed you anyway?" "Ailed me?" "Yes; what
made you groan so?" "Groan! Great Land o'Goshen! I was singing!" The
generous man will never quite cease to regret the loss of that drink
of whisky.

<center><b>True History of the Great Sea Serpent</b></center><br>
<p>
John Smith, the sea-serpent, was born in a swamp near Sydney, about
5000 years ago. He was hatched by a female Bunyip from an immense
three cornered egg, which is supposed to have fallen out of the moon,
and he is the only sea-serpent that ever existed. He never had
relations, and is the only being in the world of whom the verse is
true. He never had a father. He never had a mother. He never had a
sister. He never had a brother. He also never had a wife. He is of a
very shy disposition, and many fascinating mermaids have made love to
him, and practiced all their well-known wiles upon him&mdash;but in
vain:
he is a bachelor still. Like some other animals mentioned in history,
he thinks and talks like a man. He is exceedingly intelligent, and
seems to have as much sense as 20,000 ordinary men or 21,000 women.
He can sing with a voice of tremendous compass, from the sweet piping
of a nightingale down to far below the deepest tones of the largest
organ, or the noise made by discharges of artillery. Sometimes when
he sings it shakes the ground for miles around, and if at sea causes
a storm. His favourite songs are "A Life on the Ocean Wave," "What
are the Wild Waves Saying," "Down by the Deep Sad Sea," and such
like. He plays all the musical instruments in the world. His whistle
can be heard a distance of 100 miles, his shout 50 miles, and his
whisper 10 miles. Of course, in an active life of 5000 years, a life
almost as long as some Hindoo patriarchs, he has seen and heard, and
done, many astonishing things. He relates that he once rescued a
travelling menagerie at sea, he swallowed the whole lot of animals,
and the woman in charge of them, let them roam about inside of him
and enjoy themselves, and then landed them safely on dry land at the
end of 48 hours. He says that he was in Arabia, and saw that
remarkable occurrence of the moon coming down and going into
Mahomet's sleeves, and there and then he objected to the whole
proceeding. The sea-serpent is 15 miles long and 50 feet in diameter,
his skin is of a horny nature, but harder than steel, and about 5
feet thick. He travels at the rate of 200 miles per hour, and can
carry 120 times as much as the "Great Eastern." If he was coming up
to the Queen's Wharf, Melbourne, when his head was at the wharf, his
body would reach right down the River Yarra out in the Bay past
Williamstown, and the Traffic would have to be stopped in the river
whilst he was unloading. The sea-serpent is rather a large eater.
Since he reached full growth, namely, for the last 4000 years, he has
swallowed a whole whale every morning for breakfast except once. The
reason of his going without his breakfast that once is explained in
the following manner:&mdash;
<p>
The reader will remember the account of Jonah and the Whale in the
Talmud. It states that when Jonah was in the whale's belly, it went
out of the Mediterranean right around Africa into the Red Sea, and
that Jonah looked out through the eyes of the whale and saw the place
where the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea. The sea-serpent
states that he can corroborate this piece of history, as he happened
to be after that very whale for breakfast when he saw Jonah looking
out through its eyes. He says he did not swallow that whale, as he
had found that the whales which he had previously swallowed with
prophets inside of them did not agree with him, and consequently he
had to go that morning without his breakfast, the first time in 4000
years. Those who want any further information about the famous
sea-serpent can acquire it at Cole's Book Arcade, Melbourne, or come
and interview and question the sea-serpent himself when he arrives.
<p>
P.S.&mdash;Some people don't believe in the existence of the
sea-serpent,
but if he did not exist how could we have got his likeness and his
history? That's a question for the unbelievers to answer.

<center><b>Smoking Does Some Good, but More Evil</b></center><br>
<p>
Smoking soothes and comforts millions of the worried and the weary,
and brings much pleasure to the habitual smoker, but it always more
or less injures the health of the smoker and sometimes kills him. The
vast majority of the medical fraternity condemn smoking, especially
by the young.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking injures multitudes of boys in many respects.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking often leads to boys into bad company.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking often makes them precocious, undutiful, impudent
and callous.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking often ruins the health.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking generally stunts their growth.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking generally sallows their complexion.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking often leads them to lying.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking often leads them to stealing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking often leads them to drinking.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking degenerates the boy physically, mentally, and
morally.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smokers cannot excel in athletic sports, such as
boating, cricket, cycling.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smokers are always at the bottom of the class in school
and college, and backward at all kinds of study.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Excessive smoking causes mental and physical laziness in
boys and men.<br>
<p>
The following organs, fluids, functions, etc., of the body,
especially of the young, are frequently more or less affected by the
use of tobacco:&mdash;The blood, the heart, the nerves, the brain, the
liver, the lungs, the stomach, the throat, the saliva, the taste, the
voice, the eyes, the ears, the nose, the mouth, the tongue, the
palate, the pancreas, the lips, the teeth, the bones, the skin.
<p>
Medical men and observing experts affirm many diseases are caused or
accelerated by the use of tobacco, among which are the
following:&mdash;
Heart disease, consumption, cancer, ulceration, asthma, bronchitis,
neuralgia, paralysis, palsy, apoplexy, indigestion, dysentery,
diarrhoea, constipation, sleeplessness, melancholia, delirium
tremens, insanity.
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking frequently leads to prolonged suffering.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking often destroys the appetite.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking sometimes weakens the will power.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking sometimes leads to loss of memory.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking often leads to despondency.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking sometimes leads to suicide.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Smoking frequently leads to loss&mdash;loss by bad
health and waste of valuable time&mdash;direct loss in money required
for other purposes, and immense loss through reckless, thoughtless, or
unfortunate smokers being the cause of partial or total destruction
by fire of buildings, ships, factories, homesteads, crops, stores,
and property of many kinds; also loss of life and property
by explosions in mines, explosive factories, powder
magazines, explosive stores, etc.<br>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco using is an unclean habit, and offensive habit,
an enslaving habit, often it is an intensely selfish habit.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco fumes, especially in small and poorly-ventilated
houses or rooms, injure or destroy the health of multitudes of
wives, and injure the health of multitudes of infants and
children.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco using injures the unborn child by giving it a
puny body and an imperfect start in life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tobacco using is fast degenerating the race.<br>
<p>
A third of the recruits for the Army are disqualified through
smoking.
<p>
The following Governments have passes laws against juvenile smoking:
Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Japan, Canada, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, British Columbia, the North West
Territories, Cape Colony, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia,
Tasmania, and about 48 of the States and Territories out of 53; and
so terrible and deplorable an effect has juvenile smoking upon the
race that most other Governments are considering the advisability of
passing laws against it.
<p>
The insidious influence of cigarette smoking by boys is shown in
these examples of handwriting, taken from a London Country Council
health report. The first was written by a boy when he was a victim of
the habit; the second is the same boy's writing when he had given it
up, ten months later.

<TD align="left">
<center><b>Narcotics and Intoxicants</b></center><br>
<p>
In most parts of the word man has found out some way of stimulating,
soothing, or deadening his animal system by means of plants or drugs.
Hundreds of these stimulating, intoxicating, soothing, and stupefying
substances have been discovered and used in various countries, chief
amongst which may be mentioned&mdash;
<p>
Opium, Tobacco, Indian Hemp, Betel Nut, and Alcohol; and others are
used in a less degree, such as Coca, Kola Nut, Thorn Apple, Cocculus
Indicus, Intoxicating Toadstool, Deadly Nightshade, Henbane,
Rhododendron, Azalea, Emetic Holly, Bearded Darnel, etc. The first
five among those human pleasers and human destroyers are&mdash;
<p>
1. Alcohol, now drank in the shape of spirits, wine,
beer, or some<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
other form probably by 500,000,000 persons.<br>
2. Opium, smoked, inhaled, drank or swallowed by
probably<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;100,000,000.<br>
3. Tobacco, now smoked, chewed, and snuffed by probably
300,000,000<br>
4. Haschish, made from Indian Hemp, now smoked, chewed,
or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;swallowed by probably 150,000,000.<br>
5. Betel Nut, chewed probably by 50,000,000.<br>
<p>
These five narcotising and intoxicating poisons are used, more or
less, by half the people in the world, giving some considerable
pleasure at times, but destroying, more or less, the health of all
who use them, and gradually stunting the form and otherwise
undermining the well-being of the entire human race.
<p>
Chemistry also produces many things which are taken in the same way
and for the same purpose, such as Laudanum, Morphia, Cocaine,
Chloral, Chloroform, Ether, &amp;c., and many so-called patent
medicines.
These all tend to form habits which soothe and please for a time, but
they all damage or destroy in the end.
<p>
The great bulk of easy-going, unreflecting people have no idea what
an amount of mischief and misery the habit of using these things
inflict upon poor humanity.

<p>
Go to the top of a mountain so that you can see 50 miles in all
directions; you then observe a space 100 miles in diameter. Now the
<i>world</i> contains 25,000 such areas as that. Our world is
amazingly
vast, but our sun is a million times as large; yet we see rolling in
space thousands as large as our own, which probably have accompanying
worlds. And again, beyond this the telescope and astral-photography
reveal to us that <i>to the right, and to the left, before and behind,
above and below, and to every point of the heavens, and at immense
distances,</i> millions and millions again of enormous stellar bodies
exist, roll, revolve and travel through space. Multitudes of these
suns and worlds around us in every direction are at such immense
distances that a person travelling with the speed of light, namely,
200,000 miles, or 8 times round our earth, in a <i>second</i>, world
take
<i>1000,000 years</i> to reach them. Nor can we imagine an end to this
stupendous universe, or an end to space, for is we try to do so the
question immediately occurs, <i>what is still outside and beyond
that?</i>
And so on to incomprehensible and overwhelming infinitude. And these
many millions of suns and worlds and systems and all their parts are
clearly working together, like the most exquisitely designed
clockwork. Look at the marvellous mechanism of the human brain, the
human eye, the human hand, the human heart, and in fact the whole
human structure and composition; they all prove the truth of the
affirmation that man is "fearfully and wonderfully made." Nay
further, examine carefully every object in existence, however
stupendously large or, as shown by the microscope, infinitesimally
small, and they each and all appear equally perfect for their
purpose. Can we see all this, and think on it, and not imagine a
Designer and Controller of infinite attributes? It always appeared
to me that there must be in this vast, illimitable, and beautiful
universe, myriads of beings, superior to our weak mortal selves,
and at the head of all and over all, an immortal Being of infinite
perfections, which thinking men in all countries and ages have
called GOD. And shall not we, immortal souls, increase in knowledge
and wisdom, and as the ages roll on, more and more perceive and
understand this mighty universe and its Author? I firmly believe we
shall, and that as yet we are only beginning to live and think and
understand and appreciate.
<p>
The Supreme Being was believed in, praised and worshipped by all the
ancient peoples, and is now believed in, praised and worshipped by
the vast majority of the people of the world&mdash;it is true under
different names, but still it is the same idea&mdash;a Being without
beginning and without end&mdash;Infinite in Wisdom&mdash;Infinite in
Goodness
&mdash;Infinite in Power&mdash;Infinite in Action and, at all times,
everywhere and present.

<center><b>The Ancients' Idea of God</b></center><br>
<p>
God extends from eternity to
eternity.&mdash;<i>Aristotle.</i><br>
<p>
Nothing is more ancient than God, for He was never
created; nothing<br>
more beautiful than the world, it is the work of that
same God.&mdash;<br>
<i>Thales.</i><br>
<p>
Nature herself has imprinted on the minds of all the idea
of a God;<br>
for what nation or race of men is there that has not,
even without<br>
being taught, some idea of a God.&mdash;<i>Cicero.</i><br>
<p>
There is one God; Him the Christians, Him the Jews, Him
all the<br>
Gentile people worship.&mdash;<i>Emperor Adrian.</i><br>
<p>
Amid so much war, contest, and variety of opinion, you
will find<br>
one consenting conviction in every land that there is one
God, the<br>
King and Father of all.&mdash;<i>Maximus Tyrius.</i><br>
<p>
If we suppose a God, to Him there can be nothing mean and
nothing<br>
great. The most trivial things must be equal under His
regard as<br>
the most august. All-powerful, omniscient, and
omnipresent, He must<br>
encompass all things, and pervade all things. Ignorant of
nothing,<br>
forgetting nothing, despising nothing, He must direct
the<br>

What land or what see will man find without God? Into
what part of<br>
the earth wilt thou descend and hide thyself, O unhappy
wretch!<br>
where thou canst escape from
God?&mdash;<i>Plutarch.</i><br>
<p>
Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the
glory, and<br>
the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the
heaven and in<br>
the earth, is Thine; Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and
Thou art<br>
exalted as head above all.&mdash;<i>David.</i><br>
<p>
He is God, the Great, the Mighty, the Tremendous, the
Merciful, the<br>
Gracious, the Benign, the Wise, the Faithful, the Just,

Virtuous; Omniscience, Omnipresence, Omnipotence, are His
alone,<br>
whose Being knew no beginning, and can know no
end.&mdash;<i>The Mishna<br>

The Supreme Being whom we call God, is a necessary,
self-existent,<br>
eternal, immense, omnipotent, omniscient, and best Being;
and<br>
therefore also a Being who is and ought to be esteemed
most sacred<br>
of holy.&mdash;<i>N. Grew.</i><br>
<p>
What an immense workman is God! in miniature as well as
in the<br>
great. With the one hand, perhaps, He is making a ring of
one<br>
hundred thousand miles in diameter, to revolve round a
planet like<br>
Saturn, and with the other as forming a tooth in the ray
of a<br>
feather of a humming-bird, or a point in the claw of the
foot of a<br>
microscopic insect. When he works in miniature,
everything is<br>
gilded, polished, and perfect, but whatever is made by
human art,<br>
as a needle, etc., when viewed by a microscope, appears
rough, and<br>
coarse, and bungling.&mdash;<i>Bishop Law.</i><br>

within the range of our glasses. But what are all the
suns, comets,<br>
earths, moons, atmospheres, seas, rivers, mountains,

Every sightseer in the City of Melbourne should visit COLE'S BOOK
ARCADE. It is entirely an Australian institution, being the first of
its kind opened anywhere, and at the present time unequalled in any
city of the world. It is 3 stories high, 600 feet deep, and an
average width of 45 feet, with frontages to Bourke and Collins Sts.,
the two main arteries of Melbourne; its public walkways are half a
mile long, its galleries are supported on brass pillars, while
hundreds of rainbows (the trade mark) decorate the interior and
exterior of the establishment. There are 100 mirrors tastefully
placed throughout the building. The present Arcade was opened on Cup
Day, 1883, and has been visited every day (except Sundays), year in,
year out, by an average of 5000 people, so that during the first 35
years of its existence, more than 50 million visits were paid to it.

There are several miles of shelving and 3,000 cedar drawers. The plan
of book-drawers greatly facilitates the minute classification so that
one can find with ease any book wanted on any subject. There are two
Retail Departments of Books, one in Bourke Street, and one in Collins
Street, and a large Wholesale one of three stories between the two.
The Second-hand Book Department is 150 feet by 40. There are many
other departments including New and Second-hand Music, Stationary,
Fancy Goods, Artist's Materials, Toys, Art, Glass, and China-ware,
Tea Salon, Circulating Library, Printing Works, etc. Free music
recitals are given every afternoon and evening. Intellectual,
well-behaved people collect and friends meet and feel happy in the
Palace of Intellect.
